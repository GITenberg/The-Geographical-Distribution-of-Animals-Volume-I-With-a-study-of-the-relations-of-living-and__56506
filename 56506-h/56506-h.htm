  <p>The present work is an attempt to collect and summarize the existing information on the
  Distribution of Land Animals; and to explain the more remarkable and interesting of the facts, by
  means of established laws of physical and organic change.</p>

  <p>The main idea, which is here worked out in some detail for the whole earth, was stated sixteen
  years ago in the concluding pages of a paper on the "Zoological Geography of the Malay
  Archipelago," which appeared in the <i>Journal of Proceedings of the Linnean Society</i> for 1860;
  and again, in a paper read before the Royal Geographical Society in 1863, it was briefly
  summarized in the following passage<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"My object has been to show the important bearing of researches into the natural
    history of every part of the world, upon the study of its past history. An accurate knowledge of
    any groups of birds or of insects and of their geographical distribution, may enable us to map
    out the islands and continents of a former epoch,&mdash;the amount of difference that exists
    between the animals of adjacent districts being closely related to preceding geological changes.
    By the collection of such minute facts, alone, can we hope to fill up a great gap in the past
    history of the earth as revealed by geology, and obtain some indications of the existence of
    those ancient lands which now lie buried beneath the ocean, and have left us nothing but these
    living records of their former existence."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The detailed study of several groups of the birds and insects collected by myself in the East,
  brought prominently before me some of the curious problems of Geographical Distribution; but I
  should hardly have ventured to treat the whole subject, had it not been for the kind encouragement
  of Mr. Darwin and Professor Newton, who, about six years ago, both suggested that I should
  undertake the task. I accordingly set to work; but soon became discouraged by the great dearth of
  materials in many groups, the absence of general systematic works, and the excessive confusion
  that pervaded the classification. Neither was it easy to decide on any satisfactory method of
  treating the subject. During the next two years, however, several important catalogues and
  systematic treatises appeared, which induced me to resume my work; and during the last three years
  it has occupied a large portion of my time.</p>

  <p>After much consideration, and some abortive trials, an outline plan of the book was matured;
  and as this is, so far as I am aware, quite novel, it will be well to give a few of the reasons
  for adopting it.</p>

  <p>Most of the previous writings on Geographical Distribution appeared to me to be unsatisfactory,
  because they drew their conclusions from a more or less extensive <i>selection</i> of facts; and
  did not clearly separate groups of facts of unequal value, or those relating to groups of animals
  of unequal rank. As an example of what is meant, I may refer to Mr. Andrew Murray's large and
  valuable work on the Geographical Distribution of Mammalia, in which an immense number of coloured
  maps are used to illustrate the distribution of various groups of animals. These maps are not
  confined to groups of any fixed rank, but are devoted to a selection of groups of various grades.
  Some show the range of single species of a genus&mdash;as the lion, the tiger, the puma, and a
  species of fox; others are devoted to sections of genera,&mdash;as the true wolves; others to
  genera,&mdash;as the hyænas, and the bears; others to portions of families,&mdash;as the flying
  squirrels, and the oxen with the bisons; others to families,&mdash;as the Mustelidæ, and the
  Hystricidæ; and others to groups of families or to orders,&mdash;as the Insectivora, and the
  opossums with the kangaroos. But in no one grade are all the groups treated alike. Many genera are
  wholly unnoticed, while several families are only treated in combination with others, or are
  represented by some of the more important genera.</p>

  <p>In making these observations I by no means intend to criticise Mr. Murray's book, but merely to
  illustrate by an example, the method which has been hitherto employed, and which seems to me not
  well adapted to enable us to establish the foundations of the science of distribution on a secure
  basis. To do this, uniformity of treatment appeared to me essential, both as a matter of
  principle, and to avoid all imputation of a partial selection of facts, which may be made to prove
  anything. I determined, therefore, to take in succession every well-established family of
  terrestrial vertebrates, and to give an account of the distribution of all its component genera,
  as far as materials were available. Species, as such, are systematically
  disregarded,&mdash;firstly, because they are so numerous as to be unmanageable; and, secondly,
  because they represent the most recent modifications of form, due to a variety of often unknown
  causes, and are therefore not so clearly connected with geographical changes as are the natural
  groups of species termed genera; which may be considered to represent the average and more
  permanent distribution of an organic type, and to be more clearly influenced by the various known
  or inferred changes in the organic and physical environment.</p>

  <p>This systematic review of the distribution of families and genera, now forms the last part of
  my book&mdash;Geographical Zoology; but it was nearly the first written, and the copious materials
  collected for it enabled me to determine the zoo-geographical divisions of the earth (regions and
  sub-regions) to be adopted. I next drew up tables of the families and genera found in each region
  and sub-region; and this afforded a basis for the geographical treatment of the
  subject&mdash;Zoological Geography&mdash;the most novel, and perhaps the most useful and generally
  interesting part of my work. While this was in progress I found it necessary to make a careful
  summary of the distribution of extinct Mammalia. This was a difficult task, owing to the great
  uncertainty that prevails as to the affinities of many of the fossils, and my want of practical
  acquaintance with Palæontology; but having carefully examined and combined the works of the best
  authors, I have given what I believe is the first connected sketch of the relation of extinct
  Mammalia to the distribution of living groups, and have arrived at some very interesting and
  suggestive results.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that man is altogether omitted from the series of the animal kingdom as
  here given, and some explanation of this omission may perhaps be required. If the genus
  <i>Homo</i> had been here treated like all other genera, nothing more than the bare
  statement&mdash;"universally distributed"&mdash;could have been given;&mdash;and this would
  inevitably have provoked the criticism that it conveyed no information. If, on the other hand, I
  had given an outline of the distribution of the <i>varieties</i> or <i>races</i> of man, I should
  have departed from the plan of my work for no sufficient reason. Anthropology is a science by
  itself; and it seems better to omit it altogether from a zoological work, than to treat it in a
  necessarily superficial manner.</p>

  <p>The best method of illustrating a work of this kind was a matter requiring much consideration.
  To have had a separate coloured or shaded map for each family would have made the work too costly,
  as the terrestrial vertebrates alone would have required more than three hundred maps. I had also
  doubts about the value of this mode of illustration, as it seemed rather to attract attention to
  details than to favour the development of general views. I determined therefore to adopt a plan,
  suggested in conversation by Professor Newton; and to have one general map, showing the regions
  and sub-regions, which could be referred to by means of a series of numbers. These references I
  give in the form of diagrammatic headings to each family; and, when the map has become familiar,
  these will, I believe, convey at a glance a body of important information.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the recent extension of our knowledge of the depths of the great oceans, I
  determined to give upon this map a summary of our knowledge of the contours of the ocean bed, by
  means of tints of colour increasing in intensity with the depth. Such a map, when it can be made
  generally accurate, will be of the greatest service in forming an estimate of the more probable
  changes of sea and land during the Tertiary period; and it is on the effects of such changes that
  any satisfactory explanation of the facts of distribution must to a great extent depend.</p>

  <p>Other important factors in determining the actual distribution of animals are, the zones of
  altitude above the sea level, and the strongly contrasted character of the surface as regards
  vegetation&mdash;a primary condition for the support of animal life. I therefore designed a series
  of six maps of the regions, drawn on a uniform scale, on which the belts of altitude are shown by
  contour-shading, while the forests, pastures, deserts, and perennial snows, are exhibited by means
  of appropriate tints of colour.</p>

  <p>These maps will, I trust, facilitate the study of geographical distribution as a science, by
  showing, in some cases, an adequate cause in the nature of the terrestrial surface for the actual
  distribution of certain groups of animals. As it is hoped they will be constantly referred to,
  double folding has been avoided, and they are consequently rather small; but Mr. Stanford, and his
  able assistant in the map department, Mr. Bolton, have taken great care in working out the details
  from the latest observations; and this, combined with the clearness and the beauty of their
  execution, will I trust render them both interesting and instructive.</p>

  <p>In order to make the book more intelligible to those readers who have no special knowledge of
  systematic zoology, and to whom most of the names with which its pages are often crowded must
  necessarily be unmeaning, I give a series of twenty plates, each one illustrating at once the
  physical aspect and the special zoological character of some well-marked division of a region.
  Great care has been taken to associate in the pictures, such species only as do actually occur
  together in nature; so that each plate represents a scene which is, at all events, not an
  impossible one. The species figured all belong to groups which are either peculiar to, or very
  characteristic of, the region whose zoology they illustrate; and it is hoped that these pictures
  will of themselves serve to convey a notion of the varied types of the higher animals in their
  true geographical relations. The artist, Mr. J. B. Zwecker, to whose talent as a zoological
  draughtsman and great knowledge both of animal and vegetable forms we are indebted for this set of
  drawings, died a few weeks after he had put the final touches to the proofs. He is known to many
  readers by his vigorous illustrations of the works of Sir Samuel Baker, Livingstone, and many
  other travellers,&mdash;but these, his last series of plates, were, at my special request,
  executed with a care, delicacy, and artistic finish, which his other designs seldom exhibit. It
  must, however, be remembered, that the figures of animals here given are not intended to show
  specific or generic characters for the information of the scientific zoologist, but merely to give
  as accurate an idea as possible, of some of the more remarkable and more restricted types of beast
  and bird, amid the characteristic scenery of their native country;&mdash;and in carrying out this
  object there are probably few artists who would have succeeded better than Mr. Zwecker has
  done.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The general arrangement of the separate parts of which the work is composed, has been, to some
  extent, determined by the illustrations and maps, which all more immediately belong to Part III.
  It was at first intended to place this part last, but as this arrangement would have brought all
  the illustrations into the second volume, its place was changed,&mdash;perhaps in other respects
  for the better, as it naturally follows Part II. Yet for persons not well acquainted with zoology,
  it will perhaps be advisable to read the more important articles of Part IV. (and especially the
  observations at the end of each order) after Part II., thus making Part III. the conclusion of the
  work.</p>

  <p>Part IV. is, in fact, a book of reference, in which the distribution of all the families and
  most of the genera of the higher animals, is given in systematic order. Part III. is treated
  somewhat more popularly; and, although it is necessarily crowded with scientific names (without
  which the inferences and conclusions would have nothing solid to rest on), these may be omitted by
  the non-scientific reader, or merely noted as a certain number or proportion of peculiar generic
  types. Many English equivalents to family and generic names are, however, given; and, assisted by
  these, it is believed that any reader capable of understanding Lyell's "Principles," or Darwin's
  "Origin," will have no difficulty in following the main arguments and appreciating the chief
  conclusions arrived at in the present work.</p>

  <p>To those who are more interested in facts than in theories, the book will serve as a kind of
  dictionary of the geography and affinities of animals. By means of the copious Index, the native
  country, the systematic position, and the numerical extent of every important and well established
  genus of land-animal may be at once discovered;&mdash;information now scattered through hundreds
  of volumes.</p>

  <p>In the difficult matters of synonymy, and the orthography of generic names, I have been guided
  rather by general utility than by any fixed rules. When I have taken a whole family group from a
  modern author of repute, I have generally followed his nomenclature throughout. In other cases, I
  use the names which are to be found in a majority of modern authors, rather than follow the strict
  rule of priority in adopting some newly discovered appellation of early date. In orthography I
  have adopted all such modern emendations as seem coming into general use, and which do not lead to
  inconvenience; but where the alteration is such as to completely change the pronunciation and
  appearance of a well-known word, I have not adopted it. I have also thought it best to preserve
  the initial letter of well-known and old-established names, for convenience of reference to the
  Indices of established works. As an example I may refer to <i>Enicurus</i>,&mdash;a name which has
  been in use nearly half a century, and which is to be found under the letter <i>E</i>, in Jerdon's
  Birds of India, Blyth's Catalogue, Bonaparte's Conspectus, and the Proceedings of the Zoological
  Society of London down to 1865. Classicists now write <i>Henicurus</i> as the correct form; but
  this seems to me one of those cases in which orthographical accuracy should give way to priority,
  and still more to convenience.</p>

  <p>In combining and arranging so much detail from such varied sources, many errors and omissions
  must doubtless have occurred. Owing to my residence at a distance from the scientific libraries of
  the metropolis, I was placed at a great disadvantage; and I could hardly have completed the work
  at all, had I not been permitted to have a large number of volumes at once, from the library of
  the Zoological Society of London, and to keep them for months together;&mdash;a privilege for
  which I return my best thanks to Mr. Sclater the Secretary, and to the Council.</p>

  <p>Should my book meet with the approval of working naturalists, I venture to appeal to them, to
  assist me in rendering any future editions more complete, by sending me (to the care of my
  publishers) notes of any important omissions, or corrections of any misstatements of fact; as well
  as copies of any of their papers or essays, and especially of any lists, catalogues, and
  monographs, containing information on the classification or distribution of living or extinct
  animals.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To the many friends who have given me information or assistance I beg to tender my sincere
  thanks. Especially am I indebted to Professor Newton, who not only read through much of my rough
  MSS., but was so good as to make numerous corrections and critical notes. These were of great
  value to me, as they often contained or suggested important additional matter, or pointed out
  systematic and orthographical inaccuracies.</p>

  <p>Professor Flower was so good as to read over my chapters on extinct animals, and to point out
  several errors into which I had fallen.</p>

  <p>Dr. Günther gave me much valuable information on the classification of reptiles, marking on my
  lists the best established and most natural genera, and referring me to reliable sources of
  information.</p>

  <p>I am also greatly indebted to the following gentlemen for detailed information on special
  subjects<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>To Sir Victor Brooke, for a MS. arrangement of the genera of Bovidæ, with the details of their
  distribution:</p>

  <p>To Mr. Dresser, for lists of the characteristic birds of Northern and Arctic Europe:</p>

  <p>To Dr. Hooker, for information on the colours and odours of New Zealand plants:</p>

  <p>To Mr. Kirby, for a list of the butterflies of Chili:</p>

  <p>To Professor Mivart, for a classification of the Batrachia, and an early proof of his article
  on "Apes" in the Encyclopedia Britannica:</p>

  <p>To Mr. Salvin, for correcting my list of the birds of the Galapagos, and for other
  assistance:</p>

  <p>To Mr. Sharpe, for MS. lists of the birds of Madagascar and the Cape Verd Islands:</p>

  <p>To Canon Tristram, for a detailed arrangement of the difficult family of the
  warblers,&mdash;Sylviidæ:</p>

  <p>To Viscount Walden, for notes on the systematic arrangement of the Pycnonotidæ and Timaliidæ,
  and for an early proof of his list of the birds of the Philippine Islands.</p>

  <p>I also have to thank many naturalists, both in this country and abroad, who have sent me copies
  of their papers; and I trust they will continue to favour me in the same manner.</p>

  <p>An author may easily be mistaken in estimating his own work. I am well aware that this first
  outline of a great subject is, in parts, very meagre and sketchy; and, though perhaps
  overburthened with some kinds of detail, yet leaves many points most inadequately treated. It is
  therefore with some hesitation that I venture to express the hope that I have made some approach
  to the standard of excellence I have aimed at;&mdash;which was, that my book should bear a similar
  relation to the eleventh and twelfth chapters of the "Origin of Species," as Mr. Darwin's "Animals
  and Plants under Domestication" does to the first chapter of that work. Should it be judged worthy
  of such a rank, my long, and often wearisome labours, will be well repaid.</p>

  <p>It is a fact within the experience of most persons, that the various species of animals are not
  uniformly dispersed over the surface of the country. If we have a tolerable acquaintance with any
  district, be it a parish, a county, or a larger extent of territory, we soon become aware that
  each well-marked portion of it has some peculiarities in its animal productions. If we want to
  find certain birds or certain insects, we have not only to choose the right season but to go to
  the right place. If we travel beyond our district in various directions we shall almost certainly
  meet with something new to us; some species which we were accustomed to see almost daily will
  disappear, others which we have never seen before will make their appearance. If we go very far,
  so as to be able to measure our journey by degrees of latitude and longitude and to perceive
  important changes of climate and vegetation, the differences in the forms of animal life will
  become greater; till at length we shall come to a country where almost everything will be new, all
  the familiar creatures of our own district being replaced by others more or less differing from
  them.</p>

  <p>If we have been observant during our several journeys, and have combined and compared the facts
  we have collected, it will become apparent that the change we have witnessed has been of two
  distinct kinds. In our own and immediately surrounding districts, particular species appeared and
  disappeared because <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>the soil, the aspect, or the
  vegetation, was adapted to them or the reverse. The marshes, the heaths, the woods and forests,
  the chalky downs, the rocky mountains, had each their peculiar inhabitants, which reappeared again
  and again as we came to tracts of country suitable for them. But as we got further away we began
  to find that localities very similar to those we had left behind were inhabited by a somewhat
  different set of species; and this difference increased with distance, notwithstanding that almost
  identical external conditions might be often met with. The first class of changes is that of
  <i>stations</i>; the second that of <i>habitats</i>. The one is a <i>local</i>, the other a
  <i>geographical</i> phenomenon. The whole area over which a particular animal is found may consist
  of any number of <i>stations</i>, but rarely of more than one <i>habitat</i>. Stations, however,
  are often so extensive as to include the entire range of many species. Such are the great seas and
  oceans, the Siberian or the Amazonian forests, the North African deserts, the Andean or the
  Himalayan highlands.</p>

  <p>There is yet another difference in the nature of the change we have been considering. The new
  animals which we meet with as we travel in any direction from our starting point, are some of them
  very much like those we have left behind us, and can be at once referred to familiar types; while
  others are altogether unlike anything we have seen at home. When we reach the Alps we find another
  kind of squirrel, in Southern Italy a distinct mole, in Southern Europe fresh warblers and
  unfamiliar buntings. We meet also with totally new forms; as the glutton and the snowy owl in
  Northern, the genet and the hoopoe in Southern, and the saiga antelope and collared pratincole in
  Eastern Europe. The first series are examples of what are termed <i>representative species</i>,
  the second of distinct groups or <i>types</i> of animals. The one represents a comparatively
  recent modification, and an origin in or near the locality where it occurs; the other is a result
  of very ancient changes both organic and inorganic, and is connected with some of the most curious
  and difficult of the problems we shall have to discuss.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page5">{5}</span></div>

  <p>Having thus defined our subject, let us glance at the opinions that have generally prevailed as
  to the nature and causes of the phenomena presented by the geographical distribution of
  animals.</p>

  <p>It was long thought, and is still a popular notion, that the manner in which the various kinds
  of animals are dispersed over the globe is almost wholly due to diversities of climate and of
  vegetation. There is indeed much to favour this belief. The arctic regions are strongly
  characterised by their white bears and foxes, their reindeer, ermine, and walruses, their white
  ptarmigan, owls, and falcons; the temperate zone has its foxes and wolves, its rabbits, sheep,
  beavers, and marmots, its sparrows and its song birds; while tropical regions alone produce apes
  and elephants, parrots and peacocks, and a thousand strange quadrupeds and brilliant birds which
  are found nowhere in the cooler regions. So the camel, the gazelle and the ostrich live in the
  desert; the bison on the prairie; the tapir, the deer, and the jaguar in forests. Mountains and
  marshes, plains and rocky precipices, have each their animal inhabitants; and it might well be
  thought, in the absence of accurate inquiry, that these and other differences would sufficiently
  explain why most of the regions and countries into which the earth is popularly divided should
  have certain animals peculiar to them and should want others which are elsewhere abundant.</p>

  <p>A more detailed and accurate knowledge of the productions of different portions of the earth
  soon showed that this explanation was quite insufficient; for it was found that countries
  exceedingly similar in climate and all physical features may yet have very distinct animal
  populations. The equatorial parts of Africa and South America, for example, are very similar in
  climate and are both covered with luxuriant forests, yet their animal life is widely different;
  elephants, apes, leopards, guinea-fowls and touracos in the one, are replaced by tapirs,
  prehensile-tailed monkeys, jaguars, curassows and toucans in the other. Again, parts of South
  Africa and Australia are wonderfully similar in their soil and climate; yet one has lions,
  antelopes, zebras and giraffes; the other only kangaroos, wombats, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page6">{6}</span>phalangers and mice. In like manner parts of North America and Europe are
  very similar in all essentials of soil climate and vegetation, yet the former has racoons,
  opossums, and humming-birds; while the latter possesses moles, hedgehogs and true flycatchers.
  Equally striking are the facts presented by the distribution of many large and important groups of
  animals. Marsupials (opossums, phalangers &amp;c.) are found from temperate Van Diemen's land to
  the tropical islands of New Guinea and Celebes, and in America from Chili to Virginia. No crows
  exist in South America, while they inhabit every other part of the world, not excepting Australia.
  Antelopes are found only in Africa and Asia; the sloths only in South America; the true lemurs are
  confined to Madagascar, and the birds-of-paradise to New Guinea.</p>

  <p>If we examine more closely the distribution of animals in any extensive region, we find that
  different, though closely allied species, are often found on the opposite sides of any
  considerable barrier to their migration. Thus, on the two sides of the Andes and Rocky Mountains
  in America, almost all the mammalia, birds, and insects are of distinct species. To a less extent,
  the Alps and Pyrenees form a similar barrier, and even great rivers and river plains, as those of
  the Amazon and Ganges, separate more or less distinct groups of animals. Arms of the sea are still
  more effective, if they are permanent; a circumstance in some measure indicated by their depth.
  Thus islands far away from land almost always have very peculiar animals found nowhere else; as is
  strikingly the case in Madagascar and New Zealand, and to a less degree in the West India islands.
  But shallow straits, like the English Channel or the Straits of Malacca, are not found to have the
  same effect, the animals being nearly or quite identical on their opposite shores. A change of
  climate or a change of vegetation may form an equally effective barrier to migration. Many
  tropical and polar animals are pretty accurately limited by certain isothermal lines; and the
  limits of the great forests in most parts of the world strictly determine the ranges of many
  species.</p>

  <p>Naturalists have now arrived at the conclusion, that by some <span class="pagenum"
  id="page7">{7}</span>slow process of development or transmutation, all animals have been produced
  from those which preceded them; and the old notion that every species was specially created as
  they now exist, at a particular time and in a particular spot, is abandoned as opposed to many
  striking facts, and unsupported by any evidence. This modification of animal forms took place very
  slowly, so that the historical period of three or four thousand years has hardly produced any
  perceptible change in a single species. Even the time since the last glacial epoch, which on the
  very lowest estimate must be from 50,000 to 100,000 years, has only served to modify a few of the
  higher animals into very slightly different species. The changes of the forms of animals appear to
  have accompanied, and perhaps to have depended on, changes of physical geography, of climate, or
  of vegetation; since it is evident that an animal which is well adapted to one condition of things
  will require to be slightly changed in constitution or habits, and therefore generally in form,
  structure, or colour, in order to be equally well adapted to a changed condition of surrounding
  circumstances. Animals multiply so rapidly, that we may consider them as continually trying to
  extend their range; and thus any new land raised above the sea by geological causes becomes
  immediately peopled by a crowd of competing inhabitants, the strongest and best adapted of which
  alone succeed in maintaining their position.</p>

  <p>If we keep in view these facts&mdash;that the minor features of the earth's surface are
  everywhere slowly changing; that the forms, and structure, and habits of all living things are
  also slowly changing; while the great features of the earth, the continents, and oceans, and
  loftiest mountain ranges, only change after very long intervals and with extreme slowness; we must
  see that the present distribution of animals upon the several parts of the earth's surface is the
  final product of all these wonderful revolutions in organic and inorganic nature. The greatest and
  most radical differences in the productions of any part of the globe must be dependent on
  isolation by the most effectual and most permanent barriers. That ocean which has remained
  broadest and deepest from the most remote geological epoch <span class="pagenum"
  id="page8">{8}</span>will separate countries the productions of which most widely and radically
  differ; while the most recently-depressed seas, or the last-formed mountain ranges, will separate
  countries the productions of which are almost or quite identical. It will be evident, therefore,
  that the study of the distribution of animals and plants may add greatly to our knowledge of the
  past history of our globe. It may reveal to us, in a manner which no other evidence can, which are
  the oldest and most permanent features of the earth's surface, and which the newest. It may
  indicate the existence of islands or continents now sunk beneath the ocean, and which have left no
  record of their existence save the animal and vegetable productions which have migrated to
  adjacent lands. It thus becomes an important adjunct to geology, which can rarely do more than
  determine what lands have been raised above the waters, under what conditions and at what period;
  but can seldom ascertain anything of the position or extent of those which have sunk beneath it.
  Our present study may often enable us, not only to say where lands must have recently disappeared,
  but also to form some judgment as to their extent, and the time that has elapsed since their
  submersion.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Having thus briefly sketched the nature and objects of the subject we have to study, it will be
  necessary&mdash;before entering on a detailed examination of the zoological features of the
  different parts of the earth, and of the distribution of the orders, families, and genera of
  animals&mdash;to examine certain preliminary facts and principles essential for our guidance. We
  must first inquire what are the powers of multiplication and dispersal of the various groups of
  animals, and the nature of the barriers that most effectually limit their range. We have then to
  consider the effects of changes in physical geography and in climate; to examine the nature and
  extent of such changes as have been known to occur; to determine what others are possible or
  probable; and to ascertain the various modes in which such changes affect the structure, the
  distribution, or the very existence of animals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span></div>

  <p>Two subjects of a different nature must next engage our attention. We have to deal with two
  vast masses of facts, each involving countless details, and requiring subdivision and grouping to
  be capable of intelligible treatment. All the continents and their chief subdivisions, and all the
  more important islands of the globe, have to be compared as regards their various animal forms. To
  do this effectively we require a natural division of the earth especially adapted to our purpose;
  and we shall have to discuss at some length the reasons for the particular system adopted,&mdash;a
  discussion which must to some extent anticipate and summarize the conclusions of the whole work.
  We have also to deal with many hundreds of families and many thousands of genera of animals, and
  here too a true and natural classification is of great importance. We must therefore give a
  connected view of the classification adopted in the various classes of animals dealt with.</p>

  <p>And lastly, as the existing distribution of animals is the result and outcome of all preceding
  changes of the earth and of its inhabitants, we require as much knowledge as we can get of the
  animals of each country during past geological epochs, in order to interpret the facts we shall
  accumulate. We shall, therefore, enter upon a somewhat detailed sketch of the various forms of
  extinct animals that have lived upon the earth during the Tertiary period; discuss their
  migrations at various epochs, the changes of physical geography that they imply, and the extent to
  which they enable us to determine the birthplace of certain families and genera.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The preliminary studies above enumerated will, it is believed, enable us to see the
  bearing of many facts in the distribution of animals that would otherwise be insoluble problems;
  and, what is hardly less valuable, will teach us to estimate the comparative importance of the
  various groups of animals, and to avoid the common error of cutting the gordian knot of each
  difficulty by vast hypothetical changes in existing continents and oceans&mdash;probably the most
  permanent features of our globe.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span></div>

  <h1 class="ac" title="II. The means of Dispersal and the Migrations of Animals"
  style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;">CHAPTER II.</h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller"><span class="gsp">THE MEANS
  OF DISPERSAL AND THE MIGRATIONS OF ANIMALS.</span></span></p>

  <p>All animals are capable of multiplying so rapidly, that if a single pair were placed in a
  continent with abundance of food and no enemies, they might fully stock it in a very short time.
  Thus, a bird which produces ten pairs of young during its lifetime (and this is far below the
  fertility of many birds) will, if we take its life at five years, increase to a hundred millions
  in about forty years, a number sufficient to stock a large country. Many fishes and insects are
  capable of multiplying several thousandfold each year, so that in a few years they would reach
  billions and trillions. Even large and slow breeding mammals, which have only one at a birth but
  continue to breed from eight to ten successive years, may increase from a single pair to ten
  millions in less than forty years.</p>

  <p class="sp3">But as animals rarely have an unoccupied country to breed in, and as the food in
  any one district is strictly limited, their natural tendency is to roam in every direction in
  search of fresh pastures, or new hunting grounds. In doing so, however, they meet with many
  obstacles. Rocks and mountains have to be climbed, rivers or marshes to be crossed, deserts or
  forests to be traversed; while narrow straits or wider arms of the sea separate islands from the
  main land or continents from each other. We have now to inquire what facilities the different
  classes of animals have for overcoming these obstacles, and what kind of barriers are most
  effectual in checking their progress.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Many of the largest mammalia are able to roam over
  whole continents and are hardly <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>stopped by any
  physical obstacles. The elephant is almost equally at home on plains and mountains, and it even
  climbs to the highest summit of Adam's Peak in Ceylon, which is so steep and rocky as to be very
  difficult of ascent for man. It traverses rivers with great ease and forces its way through the
  densest jungle. There seems therefore to be no limit to its powers of wandering, but the necessity
  of procuring food and its capacity of enduring changes of climate. The tiger is another animal
  with great powers of dispersal. It crosses rivers and sometimes even swims over narrow straits of
  the sea, and it can endure the severe cold of North China and Tartary as well as the heats of the
  plains of Bengal. The rhinoceros, the lion, and many of the ruminants have equal powers of
  dispersal; so that wherever there is land and sufficient food, there are no limits to their
  possible range. Other groups of animals are more limited in their migrations. The apes, lemurs,
  and many monkeys are so strictly adapted to an arboreal life that they can never roam far beyond
  the limits of the forest vegetation. The same may be said of the squirrels, the opossums, the
  arboreal cats, and the sloths, with many other groups of less importance. Deserts or open country
  are equally essential to the existence of others. The camel, the hare, the zebra, the giraffe and
  many of the antelopes could not exist in a forest country any more than could the jerboas or the
  prairie marmots.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There are other animals which are confined to mountains, and could not extend their
  range into lowlands or forests. The goats and the sheep are the most striking group of this kind,
  inhabiting many of the highest mountains of the globe; of which the European ibex and mouflon are
  striking examples. Rivers are equally necessary to the existence of others, as the beaver, otter,
  water-vole and capybara; and to such animals high mountain-ranges or deserts must form an
  absolutely impassable barrier.</p>

  <p><i>Climate as a Limit to the Range of Mammals.</i>&mdash;Climate appears to limit the range of
  many animals, though there is some reason to believe that in many cases it is not the climate
  itself so much as the change of vegetation consequent on climate which produces the effect. The
  quadrumana appear to be limited by climate, <span class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span>since
  they inhabit almost all the tropical regions but do not range more than about 10° beyond the
  southern and 12° beyond the northern tropic, while the great bulk of the species are found only
  within an equatorial belt about 30° wide. But as these animals are almost exclusively
  fruit-eaters, their distribution depends as much on vegetation as on temperature; and this is
  strikingly shown by the fact that the <i>Semnopithecus schistaceus</i> inhabits the Himalayan
  mountains to a height of 11,000 feet, where it has been seen leaping among fir-trees loaded with
  snow-wreaths! Some northern animals are bounded by the isothermal of 32°. Such are the polar bear
  and the walrus, which cannot live in a state of nature far beyond the limits of the frozen ocean;
  but as they live in confinement in temperate countries, their range is probably limited by other
  conditions than temperature.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We must not therefore be too hasty in concluding, that animals which we now see
  confined to a very hot or a very cold climate are incapable of living in any other. The tiger was
  once considered a purely tropical animal, but it inhabits permanently the cold plains of Manchuria
  and the Amoor, a country of an almost arctic winter climate. Few animals seem to us more truly
  inhabitants of hot countries than the elephants and rhinoceroses; yet in Post-tertiary times they
  roamed over the whole of the northern continents to within the arctic circle; and we know that the
  climate was then as cold as it is now, from their entire bodies being preserved in ice. Some
  change must recently have occurred either in the climate, soil, or vegetation of Northern Asia
  which led to the extinction of these forerunners of existing tropical species; and we must always
  bear in mind that similar changes may have acted upon other species which we now find restricted
  within narrow limits, but which may once have roamed over a wide and varied territory.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Valleys and Rivers as Barriers to Mammals.</i>&mdash;To animals which thrive
  best in dry and hilly regions, a broad level and marshy valley must often prove an effectual
  barrier. The difference of vegetation and of insect life, together with an unhealthy atmosphere,
  no doubt often checks migration if it is attempted. Thus <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13">{13}</span>many animals are restricted to the slopes of the Himalayas or to the
  mountains of Central India, the flat valley of the Ganges forming a limit to their range. In other
  cases, however, it is the river rather than the valley which is the barrier. In the great
  Amazonian plains many species of monkeys, birds, and even insects are found up to the river banks
  on one side but do not cross to the other. Thus in the lower part of the Rio Negro two monkeys,
  the <i>Jacchus bicolor</i> and the <i>Brachiurus couxiou</i>, are found on the north bank of the
  river but never on the south, where a red-whiskered <i>Pithecia</i> is alone found. Higher up
  <i>Ateles paniscus</i> extends to the north bank of the river while <i>Lagothrix humboldtii</i>
  comes down to the south bank; the former being a native of Guiana, the latter of Ecuador. The
  range of the birds of the genus <i>Psophia</i> or trumpeters, is also limited by the rivers
  Amazon, Madeira, Rio Negro and some others; so that in these cases we are able to define the
  limits of distribution with an unusual degree of accuracy, and there is little doubt the same
  barriers also limit a large number of other species.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Arms of the Sea as Barriers to Mammals.</i>&mdash;Very few mammals can swim over
  any considerable extent of sea, although many can swim well for short distances. The jaguar
  traverses the widest streams in South America, and the bear and bison cross the Mississippi; and
  there can be no doubt that they could swim over equal widths of salt water, and if accidentally
  carried out to sea might sometimes succeed in reaching islands many miles distant. Contrary to the
  common notion pigs can swim remarkably well. Sir Charles Lyell tells us in his "Principles of
  Geology" that during the floods in Scotland in 1829, some pigs only six months old that were
  carried out to sea, swam five miles and got on shore again. He also states, on the authority of
  the late Edward Forbes, that a pig jumped overboard to escape from a terrier in the Grecian
  Archipelago, and swam safely to shore many miles distant. These facts render it probable that wild
  pigs, from their greater strength and activity, might under favourable circumstances cross arms of
  the sea twenty or thirty miles wide; and there are facts in the distribution of this tribe of
  animals which seem to indicate that they have sometimes done so. Deer <span class="pagenum"
  id="page14">{14}</span>take boldly to the water and can swim considerable distances, but we have
  no evidence to show how long they could live at sea or how many miles they could traverse.
  Squirrels, rats, and lemmings often migrate from northern countries in bands of thousands and
  hundreds of thousands, and pass over rivers, lakes and even arms of the sea, but they generally
  perish in the saltwater. Admitting, however, the powers of most mammals to swim considerable
  distances, we have no reason to believe that any of them could traverse without help straits of
  upwards of twenty miles in width, while in most cases a channel of half that distance would prove
  an effectual barrier.</p>

  <p><i>Ice-floes and Driftwood as Aiding the Dispersal of Mammals.</i>&mdash;In the arctic regions
  icebergs originate in glaciers which descend into the sea, and often bear masses of gravel, earth,
  and even some vegetation on their surfaces; and extensive level ice-fields break away and float
  southwards. These might often carry with them such arctic quadrupeds as frequent the ice, or even
  on rare occasions true land-animals, which might sometimes be stranded on distant continents or
  islands. But a more effectual because a more wide-spread agent, is to be found in the uprooted
  trees and rafts of driftwood often floated down great rivers and carried out to sea. Such rafts or
  islands are sometimes seen drifting a hundred miles from the mouth of the Ganges with living trees
  erect upon them; and the Amazon, the Orinoco, Mississippi, Congo, and most great rivers produce
  similar rafts. Spix and Martius declare that they saw at different times on the Amazon, monkeys,
  tiger-cats, and squirrels, being thus carried down the stream. On the Parana, pumas, squirrels,
  and many other quadrupeds have been seen on these rafts; and Admiral W. H. Smyth informed Sir C.
  Lyell that among the Philippine islands after a hurricane, he met with floating masses of wood
  with trees growing upon them, so that they were at first mistaken for islands till it was found
  that they were rapidly drifting along. Here therefore, we have ample means for carrying all the
  smaller and especially the arboreal mammals out to sea; and although in most cases they would
  perish there, yet in some favourable instances strong winds or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page15">{15}</span>unusual tidal currents might carry them safely to shores perhaps several
  hundred miles from their native country. The fact of green trees so often having been seen erect
  on these rafts is most important; for they would act as a sail by which the raft might he
  propelled in one direction for several days in succession, and thus at last reach a shore to which
  a current alone would never have carried it.</p>

  <p>There are two groups of mammals which have quite exceptional means of dispersal&mdash;the bats
  which fly, and the cetacea, seals, &amp;c., which swim. The former are capable of traversing
  considerable spaces of sea, since two North American species either regularly or occasionally
  visit the Bermudas, a distance of 600 miles from the mainland. The oceanic mammals (whales and
  porpoises) seem to have no barrier but temperature; the polar species being unable to cross the
  equator, while the tropical forms are equally unfitted for the cold polar waters. The
  shore-feeding manatees, however, can only live where they find food; and a long expanse of rocky
  coast would probably be as complete a barrier to them as a few hundred miles of open ocean. The
  amphibious seals and walruses seem many of them to be capable of making long sea journeys, some of
  the species being found on islands a thousand miles apart, but none of the arctic are identical
  with the antartic species.</p>

  <p>The otters with one exception are freshwater animals, and we have no reason to believe they
  could or would traverse any great distances of salt water. In fact, they would be less liable to
  dispersal across arms of the sea than purely terrestrial species, since their powers of swimming
  would enable them to regain the shore if accidentally carried out to sea by a sudden flood.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Birds.</i>&mdash;It would seem at first sight that no barriers could
  limit the range of birds, and that they ought to be the most ubiquitous of living things, and
  little fitted therefore to throw any light on the laws or causes of the geographical distribution
  of animals. This, however, is far from being the case; many groups of birds are almost as strictly
  limited by barriers as the mammalia; and from their larger numbers and the avidity with which they
  have been collected, they furnish <span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span>materials of the
  greatest value for our present study. The different groups of birds offer remarkable contrasts in
  the extent of their range, some being the most cosmopolite of the higher animals, while others are
  absolutely confined to single spots on the earth's surface. The petrels (<i>Procellariidæ</i>) and
  the gulls (<i>Laridæ</i>) are among the greatest wanderers; but most of the species are confined
  to one or other of the great oceans, or to the arctic or antarctic seas, a few only being found
  with scarcely any variation over almost the whole globe. The sandpipers and plovers wander along
  the shores as far as do the petrels over the ocean. Great numbers of them breed in the arctic
  regions and migrate as far as India and Australia, or down to Chili and Brazil; the species of the
  old and new worlds, however, being generally distinct. In striking contrast to these wide ranges
  we find many of the smaller perching birds, with some of the parrots and pigeons, confined to
  small islands of a few square miles in extent, or to single valleys or mountains on the
  mainland.</p>

  <p><i>Dispersal of Birds by Winds.</i>&mdash;Those groups of birds which possess no powers of
  flight, such as the ostrich, cassowary, and apteryx, are in exactly the same position as mammalia
  as regards their means of dispersal, or are perhaps even inferior to them; since, although they
  are able to cross rivers by swimming, it is doubtful if they could remain so long in the water as
  most land quadrupeds. A very large number of short-winged birds, such as toucans, pittas, and
  wrens, are perhaps worse off; for they can fly very few miles at a time, and on falling into the
  water would soon be drowned. It is only the strong-flying species that can venture to cross any
  great width of sea; and even these rarely do so unless compelled by necessity to migrate in search
  of food, or to a more genial climate. Small and weak birds are, however, often carried
  accidentally across great widths of ocean by violent gales. This is well exemplified by the large
  numbers of stragglers from North America, which annually reach the Bermudas. No less than
  sixty-nine species of American birds have occurred in Europe, most of them in Britain and
  Heligoland. They consist chiefly of migratory birds which in autumn <span class="pagenum"
  id="page17">{17}</span>return along the eastern coasts of the United States, and often fly from
  point to point across bays and inlets. They are then liable to be blown out to sea by storms,
  which are prevalent at this season; and it is almost always at this time of year that their
  occurrence has been noted on the shores of Europe. It may, however, be doubted whether this is not
  an altogether modern phenomenon, dependent on the number of vessels constantly on the Atlantic
  which afford resting-places to the wanderers; as it is hardly conceivable that such birds as
  titlarks, cuckoos, wrens, warblers, and rails, could remain on the wing without food or rest, the
  time requisite to pass over 2,000 miles of ocean. It is somewhat remarkable that no European birds
  reach the American coast but a few which pass by way of Iceland and Greenland; whereas a
  considerable number do reach the Azores, fully half way across; so that their absence can hardly
  be due to the prevailing winds being westerly. The case of the Azores is, however, an argument for
  the unassisted passage of birds for that distance; since two of the finches are peculiar
  'species,' but closely allied to European forms, so that their progenitors must, probably, have
  reached the islands before the Atlantic was a commercial highway.</p>

  <p><i>Barriers to the Dispersal of Birds.</i>&mdash;We have seen that, as a rule, wide oceans are
  an almost absolute barrier to the passage of most birds from one continent to another; but much
  narrower seas and straits are also very effectual barriers where the habits of the birds are such
  as to preserve them from being carried away by storms. All birds which frequent thickets and
  forests, and which feed near or on the ground, are secure from such accidents; and they are also
  restricted in their range by the extent of the forests they inhabit. In South America a large
  number of the birds have their ranges determined by the extent of the forest country, while others
  are equally limited to the open plains. Such species are also bounded by mountain ranges whenever
  these rise above the woody region. Great rivers, such as the Amazon, also limit the range of many
  birds, even when there would seem to be no difficulty in their crossing them. The supply of food,
  and the kind of vegetation, soil, and climate <span class="pagenum" id="page18">{18}</span>best
  suited to a bird's habits, are probably the causes which mark out the exact limits of the range of
  each species; to which must be added the prevalence of enemies of either the parent birds, the
  eggs, or the young. In the Malay Archipelago pigeons abound most where monkeys do not occur; and
  in South America the same birds are comparatively scarce in the forest plains where monkeys are
  very abundant, while they are plentiful on the open plains and campos, and on the mountain
  plateaux, where these nest-hunting quadrupeds are rarely found. Some birds are confined to swamps,
  others to mountains; some can only live on rocky streams, others on deserts or grassy plains.</p>

  <p><i>The Phenomena of Migration.</i>&mdash;The term "migration" is often applied to the
  periodical or irregular movements of all animals; but it may be questioned whether there are any
  regular migrants but birds and fishes. The annual or periodical movements of mammalia are of a
  different class. Monkeys ascend the Himalayas in summer to a height of 10,000 to 12,000 feet, and
  descend again in winter. Wolves everywhere descend from the mountains to the lowlands in severe
  weather. In dry seasons great herds of antelopes move southwards towards the Cape of Good Hope.
  The well-known lemmings, in severe winters, at long intervals, move down from the mountains of
  Scandinavia in immense numbers, crossing lakes and rivers, eating their way through haystacks, and
  surmounting every obstacle till they reach the sea, whence very few return. The alpine hare, the
  arctic fox, and many other animals, exhibit similar phenomena on a smaller scale; and generally it
  may be said, that whenever a favourable succession of seasons has led to a great multiplication of
  any species, it must on the pressure of hunger seek food in fresh localities. For such movements
  as these we have no special term. The summer and winter movements best correspond to true
  migration, but they are always on a small scale, and of limited extent; the other movements are
  rather temporary incursions than true migrations.</p>

  <p>The annual movements of many fishes are more strictly analogous to the migration of birds,
  since they take place in large bodies and often to considerable distances, and are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page19">{19}</span>immediately connected with the process of reproduction.
  Some, as the salmon, enter rivers; others, as the herring and mackerel, approach the coast in the
  breeding season; but the exact course of their migrations is unknown, and owing to our complete
  ignorance of the area each species occupies in the ocean, and the absence of such barriers and of
  such physical diversities as occur on the land, they are of far less interest and less connected
  with our present study than the movements of birds, to which we shall now confine ourselves.</p>

  <p><i>Migrations of Birds.</i>&mdash;In all the temperate parts of the globe there are a
  considerable number of birds which reside only a part of the year, regularly arriving and leaving
  at tolerably fixed epochs. In our own country many northern birds visit us in winter, such as the
  fieldfare, redwing, snow-bunting, turnstone, and numerous ducks and waders; with a few, like the
  black redstart, and (according to Rev. C. A. Johns) some of the woodcocks from the south. In the
  summer a host of birds appear&mdash;the cuckoo, the swifts and swallows, and numerous warblers,
  being the most familiar,&mdash;which stay to build their nests and rear their young, and then
  leave us again. These are true migrants; but a number of other birds visit us occasionally, like
  the waxwing, the oriole, and the beefeater, and can only be classed as stragglers, which, perhaps
  from too rapid multiplication one year and want of food the next, are driven to extend their
  ordinary range of migration to an unusual degree. We will now endeavour to sketch the chief
  phenomena of migration in different countries.</p>

  <p><i>Europe.</i>&mdash;It is well ascertained that most of the birds that spend their spring and
  summer in the temperate parts of Europe pass the winter in North Africa and Western Asia. The
  winter visitants, on the other hand, pass the summer in the extreme north of Europe and Asia, many
  of them having been found to breed in Lapland. The arrival of migratory birds from the south is
  very constant as to date, seldom varying more than a week or two, without any regard to the
  weather at the time; but the departure is less constant, and more dependent on the weather. Thus
  the swallow always comes to us about the middle <span class="pagenum" id="page20">{20}</span>of
  April, however cold it may be, while its departure may take place from the end of September to
  late in October, and is said by Forster to occur on the first N. or N.E. wind after the 20th of
  September.</p>

  <p>Almost all the migratory birds of Europe go southward to the Mediterranean, move along its
  coasts east or west, and cross over in three places only; either from the south of Spain, in the
  neighbourhood of Gibraltar, from Sicily over Malta, or to the east by Greece and Cyprus. They are
  thus always in sight of land. The passage of most small birds (and many of the larger ones too)
  takes place at night; and they only cross the Mediterranean when the wind is steady from near the
  east or west, and when there is moonlight.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact, but one that seems to be well authenticated, that the males often leave
  before the females, and both before the young birds, which in considerable numbers migrate later
  and alone. These latter, however, seldom go so far as the old ones; and numbers of young birds do
  not cross the Mediterranean, but stay in the south of Europe. The same rule applies to the
  northward migration; the young birds stopping short of the extreme arctic regions, to which the
  old birds migrate.<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> When old and young go together,
  however, the old birds take the lead. In the south of Europe few of the migratory birds stay to
  breed, but pass on to more temperate zones; thus, in the south of France, out of 350 species only
  60 breed there. The same species is often sedentary in one part of Europe and migratory in
  another; thus, the chaffinch is a constant resident in England, Germany, and the middle of France;
  but a migrant in the south of France and in Holland: the rook visits the south of France in winter
  only: the <i>Falco tinnunculus</i> is both a resident and a migrant in the south of France,
  according to M. Marcel de Serres, there being two regular passages every year, while a certain
  number always remain.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page21">{21}</span></div>

  <p>We see, then, that migration is governed by certain intelligible laws; and that it varies in
  many of its details, even in the same species, according to changed conditions. It may be looked
  upon as an exaggeration of a habit common to all locomotive animals, of moving about in search of
  food. This habit is greatly restricted in quadrupeds by their inability to cross the sea or even
  to pass through the highly-cultivated valleys of such countries as Europe; but the power of flight
  in birds enables them to cross every kind of country, and even moderate widths of sea; and as they
  mostly travel at night and high in the air, their movements are difficult to observe, and are
  supposed to be more mysterious than they perhaps are. In the tropics birds move about to different
  districts according as certain fruits become ripe, certain insects abundant, or as flooded tracts
  dry up. On the borders of the tropics and the temperate zone extends a belt of country of a more
  or less arid character, and liable to be parched at the summer solstice. In winter and early
  spring its northern margin is verdant, but it soon becomes burnt up, and most of its birds
  necessarily migrate to the more fertile regions to the north of them. They thus follow the spring
  or summer as it advances from the south towards the pole, feeding on the young flower buds, the
  abundance of juicy larvæ, and on the ripening fruits; and as soon as these become scarce they
  retrace their steps homewards to pass the winter. Others whose home is nearer the pole are driven
  south by cold, hunger, and darkness, to more hospitable climes, returning northward in the early
  summer. As a typical example of a migratory bird, let us take the nightingale. During the winter
  this bird inhabits almost all North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Jordan Valley. Early in April it
  passes into Europe by the three routes already mentioned, and spreads over France, Britain,
  Denmark, and the south of Sweden, which it reaches by the beginning of May. It does not enter
  Brittany, the Channel Islands, or the western part of England, never visiting Wales, except the
  extreme south of Glamorganshire, and rarely extending farther north than Yorkshire. It spreads
  over Central Europe, through Austria and Hungary to Southern Russia and the warmer parts of
  Siberia, <span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span>but it nevertheless breeds in the Jordan
  Valley, so that in some places it is only the surplus population that migrates. In August and
  September, all who can return to their winter quarters.</p>

  <p>Migrations of this type probably date back from at least the period when there was continuous
  land along the route passed over; and it is a suggestive fact that this land connection is known
  to have existed in recent geological times. Britain was connected with the Continent during, and
  probably before, the glacial epoch; and Gibraltar, as well as Sicily and Malta, were also recently
  united with Africa, as is proved by the fossil elephants and other large mammalia found in their
  caverns, by the comparatively shallow water still existing in this part of the Mediterranean while
  the remainder is of oceanic profundity, and by the large amount of identity in the species of land
  animals still inhabiting the opposite shores of the Mediterranean. The submersion of these two
  tracts of land (which were perhaps of considerable extent) would be a slow process, and from year
  to year the change might be hardly perceptible. It is easy to see how the migration that had once
  taken place over continuous land would be kept up, first over lagoons and marshes, then over a
  narrow channel, and subsequently over a considerable sea, no one generation of birds ever
  perceiving any difference in the route.</p>

  <p>There is, however, no doubt that the sea-passage is now very dangerous to many birds. Quails
  cross in immense flocks, and great numbers are drowned at sea whenever the weather is
  unfavourable. Some individuals always stay through the winter in the south of Europe, and a few
  even in England and Ireland; and were the sea to become a little wider the migration would cease,
  and the quail, like some other birds, would remain divided between south Europe and north Africa.
  Aquatic birds are observed to follow the routes of great rivers and lakes, and the shores of the
  sea. One great body reaches central Europe by way of the Danube from the shores of the Black Sea;
  another ascends the Rhone Valley from the Gulf of Lyons.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span></div>

  <p><i>India and China.</i>&mdash;In the peninsula of India and in China great numbers of northern
  birds arrive during September and October, and leave from March to May. Among the smaller birds
  are wagtails, pipits, larks, stonechats, warblers, thrushes, buntings, shrikes, starlings,
  hoopoes, and quails. Some species of cranes and storks, many ducks, and great numbers of
  <i>Scolopacidæ</i> also visit India in winter; and to prey upon these come a band of rapacious
  birds&mdash;the peregrine falcon, the hobby, kestrel, common sparrowhawk, harrier, and the
  short-eared owl. These birds are almost all natives of Europe and Western Asia; they spread over
  all northern and central India, mingling with the sedentary birds of the oriental fauna, and give
  to the ornithology of Hindostan at this season quite a European aspect. The peculiar species of
  the higher Himalayas do not as a rule descend to the plains in winter, but merely come lower down
  the mountains; and in southern India and Ceylon comparatively few of these migratory birds
  appear.</p>

  <p>In China the migratory birds follow generally the coast line, coming southwards in winter from
  eastern Siberia and northern Japan; while a few purely tropical forms travel northwards in summer
  to Japan, and on the mainland as far as the valley of the Amoor.</p>

  <p><i>North America.</i>&mdash;The migrations of birds in North America have been carefully
  studied by resident naturalists, and present some interesting features. The birds of the eastern
  parts of North America are pre-eminently migratory, a much smaller proportion being permanent
  residents than in corresponding latitudes in Europe. Thus, in Massachusetts there are only about
  30 species of birds which are resident all the year, while the regular summer visitors are 106.
  Comparing with this our own country, though considerably further north, the proportions are
  reversed; there being 140 residents and 63 summer visitors. This difference is clearly due to the
  much greater length and severity of the winter, and the greater heat of summer, in America than
  with us. The number of permanent residents increases pretty regularly as we go southward; but the
  number of birds at any locality during the breeding season seems to increase as we go <span
  class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span>northward as far as Canada, where, according to Mr. Allen,
  more species breed than in the warm Southern States. Even in the extreme north, beyond the limit
  of forests, there are no less than 60 species which breed; in Canada about 160; while in Carolina
  there are only 135, and in Louisiana, 130. The extent of the migration varies greatly, some
  species only going a few degrees north and south, while others migrate annually from the tropics
  to the extreme north of the continent; and every gradation occurs between these extremes. Among
  those which migrate furthest are the species of <i>Dendr&#x0153;ca</i>, and other American
  flycatching warblers (<i>Mniotiltidæ</i>), many of which breed on the shores of Hudson's Bay, and
  spend the winter in Mexico or the West Indian islands.</p>

  <p>The great migratory movement of American birds is almost wholly confined to the east coast; the
  birds of the high central plains and of California being for the most part sedentary, or only
  migrating for short distances. All the species which reach South America, and most of those which
  winter in Mexico and Guatemala, are exclusively eastern species; though a few Rocky Mountain birds
  range southward along the plateaux of Mexico and Guatemala, but probably not as regular annual
  migrants.</p>

  <p>In America as in Europe birds appear in spring with great regularity, while the time of the
  autumnal return is less constant. More curious is the fact, also observed in both hemispheres,
  that they do not all return by the same route followed in going northwards, some species being
  constant visitors to certain localities in spring but not in autumn, others in autumn but not in
  spring.</p>

  <p>Some interesting cases have been observed in America of a gradual alteration in the extent of
  the migration of certain birds. A Mexican swallow (<i>Hirundo lunifrons</i>) first appeared in
  Ohio in 1815. Year by year it increased the extent of its range till by 1845 it had reached Maine
  and Canada; and it is now quoted by American writers as extending its annual migrations to
  Hudson's Bay. An American wren (<i>Troglodytes ludovicianus</i>) is another bird which has spread
  considerably northwards since <span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span>the time of the
  ornithologist Wilson; and the rice-bird, or "Bob-o'-link," of the Americans, continually widens
  its range as rice and wheat are more extensively cultivated. This bird winters in Cuba and other
  West Indian Islands, and probably also in Mexico. In April it enters the Southern States and
  passes northward, till in June it reaches Canada and extends west to the Saskatchewan River in 54°
  north latitude.</p>

  <p><i>South Temperate America.</i>&mdash;The migratory birds of this part of the world have been
  observed by Mr. Hudson at Buenos Ayres. As in Europe and North America, there are winter and
  summer visitors, from Patagonia and the tropics respectively. Species of <i>Pyrocephalus</i>,
  <i>Milvulus</i>, swallows, and a hummingbird, are among the most regular of the summer visitors.
  They are all insectivorous birds. From Patagonia species of <i>Tænioptera</i>, <i>Cinclodes</i>,
  and <i>Centrites</i>, come in winter, with two gulls, two geese, and six snipes and plovers. Five
  species of swallows appear at Buenos Ayres in spring, some staying to breed, others passing on to
  more temperate regions farther south. As a rule the birds which come late and leave early are the
  most regular. Some are very irregular in their movements, the <i>Molothrus bonariensis</i>, for
  example, sometimes leaves early in autumn, sometimes remains all the winter. Some resident birds
  also move in winter to districts where they are never seen in summer.</p>

  <p><i>General Remarks on Migration.</i>&mdash;The preceding summary of the main facts of migration
  (which might have been almost indefinitely extended, owing to the great mass of detailed
  information that exists on the subject) appears to accord with the view already suggested, that
  the "instinct" of migration has arisen from the habit of wandering in search of food common to all
  animals, but greatly exaggerated in the case of birds by their powers of flight and by the
  necessity for procuring a large amount of soft insect food for their unfledged young. Migration in
  its simple form may be best studied in North America, where it takes place over a continuous land
  surface with a considerable change of climate from south to north. We have here (as probably in
  Europe and elsewhere) every grade of migration, from species which merely shift the northern and
  southern <span class="pagenum" id="page26">{26}</span>limits of their range a few hundred miles,
  so that in the central parts of the area the species is a permanent resident, to others which move
  completely over 1,000 miles of latitude, so that in all the intervening districts they are only
  known as birds of passage. Now, just as the rice-bird and the Mexican swallow have extended their
  migrations, owing to favourable conditions induced by human agency; so we may presume that large
  numbers of species would extend their range where favourable conditions arose through natural
  causes. If we go back only as far as the height of the glacial epoch, there is reason to believe
  that all North America, as far south as about 40° north latitude, was covered with an almost
  continuous and perennial ice-sheet. At this time the migratory birds would extend up to this
  barrier (which would probably terminate in the midst of luxuriant vegetation, just as the glaciers
  of Switzerland now often terminate amid forests and corn-fields), and as the cold decreased and
  the ice retired almost imperceptibly year by year, would follow it up farther and farther
  according as the peculiarities of vegetation and insect-food were more or less suited to their
  several constitutions. It is an ascertained fact that many individual birds return year after year
  to build their nests in the same spot. This shows a strong local attachment, and is, in fact, the
  faculty or feeling on which their very existence probably depends. For were they to wander at
  random each year, they would almost certainly not meet with places so well suited to them, and
  might even get into districts where they or their young would inevitably perish. It is also a
  curious fact that in so many cases the old birds migrate first, leaving the young ones behind, who
  follow some short time later, but do not go so far as their parents. This is very strongly opposed
  to the notion of an imperative instinct. The old birds have been before, the young have not; and
  it is only when the old ones have all or nearly all gone that the young go too, probably following
  some of the latest stragglers. They wander, however, almost at random, and the majority are
  destroyed before the next spring. This is proved by the fact that the birds which return in spring
  are as a rule not more numerous than those which came the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page27">{27}</span>preceding spring, whereas those which went away in autumn were two or three
  times as numerous. Those young birds that do get back, however, have learnt by experience, and the
  next year they take care to go with the old ones. The most striking fact in favour of the
  "instinct" of migration is the "agitation," or excitement, of confined birds at the time when
  their wild companions are migrating. It seems probable, however, that this is what may be called a
  social excitement, due to the anxious cries of the migrating birds; a view supported by the fact
  stated by Marcel de Serres, that the black swan of Australia, when domesticated in Europe,
  sometimes joins wild swans in their northward migration. We must remember too that migration at
  the proper time is in many cases absolutely essential to the existence of the species; and it is
  therefore not improbable that some strong social emotion should have been gradually developed in
  the race, by the circumstance that all who for want of such emotion did not join their fellows
  inevitably perished.</p>

  <p>The mode by which a passage originally overland has been converted into one over the sea offers
  no insuperable difficulties, as has already been pointed out. The long flights of some birds
  without apparently stopping on the way is thought to be inexplicable, as well as their finding
  their nesting-place of the previous year from a distance of many hundreds or even a thousand
  miles. But the observant powers of animals are very great; and birds flying high in the air may be
  guided by the physical features of the country spread out beneath them in a way that would be
  impracticable to purely terrestrial animals.</p>

  <p>It is assumed by some writers that the breeding-place of a species is to be considered as its
  true home rather than that to which it retires in winter; but this can hardly be accepted as a
  rule of universal application. A bird can only breed successfully where it can find sufficient
  food for its young; and the reason probably why so many of the smaller birds leave the warm
  southern regions to breed in temperate or even cold latitudes, is because caterpillars and other
  soft insect larvæ are there abundant at the proper time, while in their winter home the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page28">{28}</span>larvæ have all changed into winged insects. But this
  favourable breeding district will change its position with change of climate; and as the last
  great change has been one of increased warmth in all the temperate zones, it is probable that many
  of the migratory birds are comparatively recent visitors. Other changes may however have taken
  place, affecting the vegetation and consequently the insects of a district; and we have seldom the
  means of determining in any particular case in what direction the last extension of range
  occurred. For the purposes of the study of geographical distribution therefore, we must, except in
  special cases, consider the true range of a species to comprise all the area which it occupies
  regularly for any part of the year, while all those districts which it only visits at more or less
  distant intervals, apparently driven by storms or by hunger, and where it never regularly or
  permanently settles, should not be included as forming part of its area of distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;If we leave out of consideration the
  true marine groups&mdash;the turtles and sea-snakes&mdash;reptiles are scarcely more fitted for
  traversing seas and oceans than are mammalia. We accordingly find that in those oceanic islands
  which possess no indigenous mammals, land reptiles are also generally wanting. The several groups
  of these animals, however, differ considerably both in their means of dispersal and in their power
  of resisting adverse conditions. Snakes are most dependent on climate, becoming very scarce in
  temperate and cold climates and entirely ceasing at 62° north latitude, and they do not ascend
  very lofty mountains, ceasing at 6,000 feet elevation in the Alps. Some inhabit deserts, others
  swamps and marshes, while many are adapted for a life in forests. They swim rivers easily, but
  apparently have no means of passing the sea, since they are very rarely found on oceanic islands.
  Lizards are also essentially tropical, but they go somewhat farther north than snakes, and ascend
  higher on the mountains, reaching 10,000 feet in the Alps. They possess too some unknown means
  (probably in the egg-state) of passing over the ocean, since they are found to inhabit many
  islands where there are neither mammalia nor snakes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span></div>

  <p>The amphibia are much less sensitive to cold than are true reptiles, and they accordingly
  extend much farther north, frogs being found within the arctic circle. Their semi-aquatic life
  also gives them facilities for dispersal, and their eggs are no doubt sometimes carried by aquatic
  birds from one pond or stream to another. Salt water is fatal to them as well as to their eggs,
  and hence it arises that they are seldom found in those oceanic islands from which mammalia are
  absent. Deserts and oceans would probably form the most effectual barriers to their dispersal;
  whereas both snakes and lizards abound in deserts, and have some means of occasionally passing the
  ocean which frogs and salamanders do not seem to possess.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Fishes.</i>&mdash;The fact that the same species of freshwater fish
  often inhabit distinct river systems, proves that they have some means of dispersal over land. The
  many authentic accounts of fish falling from the atmosphere, indicate one of the means by which
  they may be transferred from one river basin to another, viz., by hurricanes and whirlwinds, which
  often carry up considerable quantities of water and with it fishes of small size. In volcanic
  countries, also, the fishes of subterranean streams may sometimes be thrown up by volcanic
  explosions, as Humboldt relates happened in South America. Another mode by which fishes may be
  distributed is by their eggs being occasionally carried away by aquatic birds; and it is stated by
  Gmelin that geese and ducks during their migrations feed on the eggs of fish, and that some of
  these pass through their bodies with their vitality unimpaired.<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Even water-beetles flying from one pond to another might
  occasionally carry with them some of the smaller eggs of fishes. But it is probable that
  fresh-water fish are also enabled to migrate by changes of level causing streams to alter their
  course and carry their waters into adjacent basins. On plateaux the sources of distinct river
  systems often approach each other, and the same thing occurs with lateral tributaries on the
  lowlands near their mouths. Such changes, although small in extent, and occurring only at long
  intervals, would <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>act very powerfully in modifying the
  distribution of fresh-water fish.</p>

  <p>Sea fish would seem at first sight to have almost unlimited means of dispersal, but this is far
  from being the case. Temperature forms a complete barrier to a large number of species, cold water
  being essential to many, while others can only dwell in the warmth of the tropics. Deep water is
  another barrier to large numbers of species which are adapted to shores and shallows; and thus the
  Atlantic is quite as impassable a gulf to most fishes as it is to birds. Many sea fishes migrate
  to a limited extent for the purpose of depositing their spawn in favourable situations. The
  herring, an inhabitant of the deep sea, comes in shoals to our coast in the breeding season; while
  the salmon quits the northern seas and enters our rivers, mounting upwards to the clear cold water
  near their sources to deposit its eggs. Keeping in mind the essential fact that changes of
  temperature and of depth are the main barriers to the dispersal of fish, we shall find little
  difficulty in tracing the causes that have determined their distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Mollusca.</i>&mdash;The marine, fresh-water, and land mollusca are
  three groups whose powers of dispersal and consequent distribution are very different, and must be
  separately considered. The <i>Pteropoda</i>, the <i>Ianthina</i>, and other groups of floating
  molluscs, drift about in mid-ocean, and their dispersal is probably limited chiefly by
  temperature, but perhaps also by the presence of enemies or the scarcity of proper food. The
  univalve and bivalve mollusca, of which the whelk and the cockle may be taken as types, move so
  slowly in their adult state, that we should expect them to have an exceedingly limited
  distribution; but the young of all these are free swimming embryos, and they thus have a powerful
  means of dispersal, and are carried by tides and currents so as ultimately to spread over every
  shore and shoal that offers conditions favourable for their development. The fresh water molluscs,
  which one might at first suppose could not range beyond their own river-basin, are yet very widely
  distributed in common with almost all other fresh water productions; and Mr. Darwin has shown that
  this is <span class="pagenum" id="page31">{31}</span>due to the fact, that ponds and marshes are
  constantly frequented by wading and swimming birds which are pre-eminently wanderers, and which
  frequently carry away with them the seeds of plants, and the eggs of molluscs and aquatic insects.
  Fresh water molluscs just hatched were found to attach themselves to a duck's foot suspended in an
  aquarium; and they would thus be easily carried from one lake or river to another, and by the help
  of different species of aquatic birds, might soon spread all over the globe. Even a water-beetle
  has been caught with a small living shell (<i>Ancylus</i>) attached to it; and these fly long
  distances and are liable to be blown out to sea, one having been caught on board the <i>Beagle</i>
  when forty-five miles from land. Although fresh water molluscs and their eggs must frequently be
  carried out to sea, yet this cannot lead to their dispersal, since salt water is almost
  immediately fatal to them; and we are therefore forced to conclude that the apparently
  insignificant and uncertain means of dispersal above alluded to are really what have led to their
  wide distribution. The true land-shells offer a still more difficult case, for they are
  exceedingly sensitive to the influence of salt water; they are not likely to be carried by aquatic
  birds, and yet they are more or less abundant all over the globe, inhabiting the most remote
  oceanic islands. It has been found, however, that land-shells have the power of lying dormant a
  long time. Some have lived two years and a half shut up in pill boxes; and one Egyptian desert
  snail came to life after having been glued down to a tablet in the British Museum for four
  years!</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Mr. Darwin for experiments on the power of land shells to resist sea water,
  and he found that when they had formed a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell they
  survived many days' immersion (in one case fourteen days); and another experimenter, quoted by Mr.
  Darwin, found that out of one hundred land shells immersed for a fortnight in the sea,
  twenty-seven recovered. It is therefore quite possible for them to be carried in the chinks of
  drift wood for many hundred miles across the sea, and this is probably one of the most effectual
  modes of their dispersal. Very young shells would also <span class="pagenum"
  id="page32">{32}</span>sometimes attach themselves to the feet of birds walking or resting on the
  ground, and as many of the waders often go far inland, this may have been one of the methods of
  distributing species of land shells; for it must always be remembered that nature can afford to
  wait, and that if but once in a thousand years a single bird should convey two or three minute
  snails to a distant island, this is all that is required for us to find that island well stocked
  with a great and varied population of land shells.</p>

  <p><i>Means of Dispersal of Insects and the Barriers which Limit their Range.</i>&mdash;Winged
  insects, as a whole, have perhaps more varied means of dispersal over the globe than any other
  highly organised animals. Many of them can fly immense distances, and the more delicate ones are
  liable to be carried by storms and hurricanes over a wide expanse of ocean. They are often met
  with far out at sea. Hawk-moths frequently fly on board ships as they approach the shores of
  tropical countries, and they have sometimes been captured more than 250 miles from the nearest
  land. Dragon-flies came on board the <i>Adventure</i> frigate when fifty miles off the coast of
  South America. A southerly wind brought flies in myriads to Admiral Smyth's ship in the
  Mediterranean when he was 100 miles distant from the coast of Africa. A large Indian beetle
  (<i>Chrysochroa ocellata</i>) was quite recently caught alive in the Bay of Bengal by Captain
  Payne of the barque <i>William Mansoon</i>, 273 miles from the nearest land. Darwin caught a
  locust 370 miles from land; and in 1844 swarms of locusts several miles in extent, and as thick as
  the flakes in a heavy snowstorm, visited Madeira. These must have come with perfect safety more
  than 300 miles; and as they continued flying over the island for a long time, they could evidently
  have travelled to a much greater distance. Numbers of living beetles belonging to seven genera,
  some aquatic and some terrestrial, were caught by Mr. Darwin in the open sea, seventeen miles from
  the coast of South America, and they did not seem injured by the salt water. Almost all the
  accidental causes that lead to the dispersal of the higher animals would be still more favourable
  for insects. Floating trees could carry hundreds of insects for one bird or mammal; and so many of
  the larvæ, eggs, <span class="pagenum" id="page33">{33}</span>and pupæ of insects have their abode
  in solid timber, that they might survive being floated immense distances. Great numbers of
  tropical insects have been captured in the London docks, where they have been brought in foreign
  timber; and some have emerged from furniture after remaining torpid for many years. Most insects
  have the power of existing weeks or months without food, and some are very tenacious of life. Many
  beetles will survive immersion for hours in strong spirit; and water a few degrees below the
  boiling point will not always kill them. We can therefore easily understand how, in the course of
  ages insects may become dispersed by means which would be quite inadequate in the case of the
  higher animals. The drift-wood and tropical fruits that reach Ireland and the Orkneys; the double
  cocoa-nuts that cross the Indian ocean from the Seychelle Islands to the coast of Sumatra; the
  winds that carry volcanic dust and ashes for thousands of miles; the hurricanes that travel in
  their revolving course over wide oceans; all indicate means by which a few insects may, at rare
  intervals be carried to remote regions, and become the progenitors of a group of allied forms.</p>

  <p class="sp5">But the dispersal of insects requires to be looked at from another point of view.
  They are, of all animals, perhaps the most wonderfully adapted for special conditions; and are so
  often fitted to fill one place in nature and one only, that the barriers against their permanent
  displacement are almost as numerous and as effective as their means of dispersal. Hundreds of
  species of lepidoptera, for example, can subsist in the larva state only on one species of plant;
  so that even if the perfect insects were carried to a new country, the continuance of the race
  would depend upon the same or a closely allied plant being abundant there. Other insects require
  succulent vegetable food all the year round, and are therefore confined to tropical regions; some
  can live only in deserts, others in forests; some are dependent on water-plants, some on
  mountain-vegetation. Many are so intimately connected with other insects during some part of their
  existence that they could not live without them; such are the parasitical hymenoptera and diptera,
  and those mimicking species whose welfare depends upon their being <span class="pagenum"
  id="page34">{34}</span>mistaken for something else. Then again, insects have enemies in every
  stage of their existence&mdash;the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the perfect form; and the
  abundance of any one of these enemies may render their survival impossible in a country otherwise
  well suited to them. Ever bearing in mind these two opposing classes of facts, we shall not be
  surprised at the enormous range of some groups of insects, and at the extreme localization of
  others; and shall be able to give a rational account of many phenomena of distribution that would
  otherwise seem quite unintelligible.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller"><span
  class="gsp">DISTRIBUTION AS AFFECTED BY THE CONDITIONS AND CHANGES OF THE EARTH'S
  SURFACE.</span></span></p>

  <p>The distribution of animals over the earth's surface, is evidently dependent in great measure
  upon those grand and important characteristics of our globe, the study of which is termed physical
  geography. The proportion of land and water; the outlines and distribution of continents; the
  depth of seas and oceans; the position of islands; the height, direction, and continuity of
  mountain chains; the position and extent of deserts, lakes, and forests; the direction and
  velocity of ocean currents, as well as of prevalent winds and hurricanes; and lastly, the
  distribution of heat and cold, of rain, snow, and ice, both in their means and in their extremes,
  have all to be considered when we endeavour to account for the often unequal and unsymmetrical
  manner in which animals are dispersed over the globe. But even this knowledge is insufficient
  unless we inquire further as to the evidence of permanence possessed by each of these features, in
  order that we may give due weight to the various causes that have led to the existing facts of
  animal distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Land and Water.</i>&mdash;The well-known fact that nearly three-fourths of the surface of
  the earth is occupied by water, and but a little more than one-fourth by land, is important as
  indicating the vast extent of ocean by which many of the continents and islands are separated from
  each other. But there is another fact <span class="pagenum" id="page36">{36}</span>which greatly
  increases its importance, namely, that the mean height of the land is very small compared with the
  mean depth of the sea. It has been estimated by Humboldt that the mean height of all the land
  surface does not exceed a thousand feet, owing to the comparative narrowness of mountain ranges
  and the great extent of alluvial plains and valleys; the ocean bed, on the contrary, not only
  descends deeper than the tops of the highest mountains rise above its surface, but these profound
  depths are broad sunken plains, while the shallows correspond to the mountain ranges, so that its
  mean depth is, as nearly as can be estimated, twelve thousand feet.<a id="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Hence, as the area of water is three times that of the land, the
  total cubical contents of the land, above the sea level, would be only that of the waters which
  are below that level. The important result follows, that whereas it is scarcely possible that in
  past times the amount of land surface should ever greatly have exceeded that which now exists, it
  is just possible that all the land may have been at some time submerged; and therefore in the
  highest degree probable that among the continual changes of land and sea that have been always
  going on, the amount of land surface has often been much less than it is now. For the same reason
  it is probable that there have been times when large masses of land have been more isolated from
  the rest than they are at present; just as South America would be if North America were submerged,
  or as Australia would become if the Malay Archipelago were to sink beneath the ocean. It is also
  very important to bear in mind the fact insisted on by Sir Charles Lyell, that the shallow parts
  of the ocean are almost always in the vicinity of land; and that an amount of elevation that would
  make little difference to the bed of the ocean, would raise up extensive tracts of dry land in the
  vicinity of existing continents. It is almost certain, therefore, that changes in the distribution
  of land and sea must have taken place more frequently by additions to, or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page37">{37}</span>modifications of pre-existing land, than by the upheaval of entirely new
  continents in mid-ocean. These two principles will throw light upon two constantly recurring
  groups of facts in the distribution of animals,&mdash;the restriction of peculiar forms to areas
  not at present isolated,&mdash;and on the other hand, the occurrence of allied forms in lands
  situated on opposite shores of the great oceans.</p>

  <p><i>Continental Areas.</i>&mdash;Although the dry land of the earth's surface is distributed
  with so much irregularity, that there is more than twice as much north of the equator as there is
  south of it, and about twice as much in the Asiatic as in the American hemisphere; and, what is
  still more extraordinary, that on a hemisphere of which a point in St. George's Channel between
  England and Ireland is the centre, the land is nearly equal in extent to the water, while in the
  opposite hemisphere it is in the proportion of only one-eighth,&mdash;yet the whole of the land is
  almost continuous. It consists essentially of only three masses: the American, the Asia-African,
  and the Australian. The two former are only separated by thirty-six miles of shallow sea at
  Behring's Straits, so that it is possible to go from Cape Horn to Singapore or the Cape of Good
  Hope without ever being out of sight of land; and owing to the intervention of the numerous
  islands of the Malay Archipelago the journey might be continued under the same conditions as far
  as Melbourne and Hobart Town. This curious fact, of the almost perfect continuity of all the great
  masses of land notwithstanding their extremely irregular shape and distribution, is no doubt
  dependent on the circumstances just alluded to; that the great depth of the oceans and the
  slowness of the process of upheaval, has almost always produced the new lands either close to, or
  actually connected with pre-existing lands; and this has necessarily led to a much greater
  uniformity in the distribution of organic forms, than would have prevailed had the continents been
  more completely isolated from each other.</p>

  <p>The isthmuses which connect Africa with Asia, and North with South America, are, however, so
  small and insignificant compared with the vast extent of the countries they unite that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>we can hardly consider them to form more than a nominal
  connection. The Isthmus of Suez indeed, being itself a desert, and connecting districts which for
  a great distance are more or less desert also, does not effect any real union between the
  luxuriant forest-clad regions of intertropical Asia and Africa. The Isthmus of Panama is a more
  effectual line of union, since it is hilly, well watered, and covered with luxuriant vegetation;
  and we accordingly find that the main features of South American zoology are continued into
  Central America and Mexico. In Asia a great transverse barrier exists, dividing that continent
  into a northern and southern portion; and as the lowlands occur on the south and the highlands on
  the north of the great mountain range, which is situated not far beyond the tropic, an abrupt
  change of climate is produced; so that a belt of about a hundred miles wide, is all that
  intervenes between a luxuriant tropical region and an almost arctic waste. Between the northern
  part of Asia, and Europe, there is no barrier of importance; and it is impossible to separate
  these regions as regards the main features of animal life. Africa, like Asia, has a great
  transverse barrier, but it is a desert instead of a mountain chain; and it is found that this
  desert is a more effectual barrier to the diffusion of animals than the Mediterranean Sea; partly
  because it coincides with the natural division of a tropical from a temperate climate, but also on
  account of recent geological changes which we shall presently allude to. It results then from this
  outline sketch of the earth's surface, that the primary divisions of the geographer correspond
  approximately with those of the zoologist. Some large portion of each of the popular divisions
  forms the nucleus of a zoological region; but the boundaries are so changed that the geographer
  would hardly recognise them: it has, therefore, been found necessary to give them those distinct
  names which will be fully explained in our next chapter.</p>

  <p><i>Recent Changes in the Continental Areas.</i>&mdash;The important fact has been now
  ascertained, that a considerable portion of the Sahara south of Algeria and Morocco was under
  water at a very recent epoch. Over much of this area sea-shells, identical with those now living
  in the Mediterranean, are abundantly scattered, <span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>not
  only in depressions below the level of the sea but up to a height of 900 feet above it. Borings
  for water made by the French government have shown, that these shells occur twenty feet deep in
  the sand; and the occurrence of abundance of salt, sometimes even forming considerable hills, is
  an additional proof of the disappearance of a large body of salt water. The common cockle is one
  of the most abundant of the shells found; and the Rev. H. B. Tristram discovered a new fish, in a
  salt lake nearly 300 miles inland, but which has since been found to inhabit the Gulf of Guinea.
  Connected with this proof of recent elevation in the Sahara, we have most interesting indications
  of subsidence in the area of the Mediterranean, which were perhaps contemporaneous. Sicily and
  Malta are connected with Africa by a submerged bank from 300 to 1,200 feet below the surface;
  while the depth of the Mediterranean, both to the east and west, is enormous, in some parts more
  than 13,000 feet; and another submerged bank with a depth of 1,000 feet occurs at the straits of
  Gibraltar. In caves in Sicily, remains of the living African elephant have been found by Baron
  Anca; and in other caves Dr. Falconer discovered remains of the <i>Elephas antiquus</i> and of two
  species of <i>Hippopotamus</i>. In Malta, three species of elephant have been discovered by
  Captain Spratt; a large one closely allied to <i>E. antiquus</i> and two smaller ones not
  exceeding five feet high when adult. These facts clearly indicate, that when North Africa was
  separated by a broad arm of the sea from the rest of the continent, it was probably connected with
  Europe; and this explains why zoologists find themselves obliged to place it along with Europe in
  the same zoological region.</p>

  <p>Besides this change in the level of the Sahara and the Mediterranean basin, Europe has
  undergone many fluctuations in its physical geography in very recent times. In Wales, abundance of
  sea-shells of living species have been found at an elevation of 1,300 feet; and in Sardinia there
  is proof of an elevation of 300 feet since the human epoch; and these are only samples of many
  such changes of level. But these changes, though very important locally and as connected with
  geological problems, need not be further noticed here; as they were not of a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page40">{40}</span>nature to affect the larger features of the earth's surface or to determine
  the boundaries of great zoological regions.</p>

  <p>The only other recent change of great importance which can be adduced to illustrate our present
  subject, is that which has taken place between North and South America. The living marine shells
  of the opposite coasts of the isthmus of Panama, as well as the corals and fishes, are generally
  of distinct species, but some are identical and many are closely allied; the West Indian fossil
  shells and corals of the Miocene period, however, are found to be largely identical with those of
  the Pacific coast. The fishes of the Atlantic and Pacific shores of America are as a rule very
  distinct; but Dr. Günther has recently shown that a considerable number of species inhabiting the
  seas on opposite sides of the isthmus are absolutely identical. These facts certainly indicate,
  that during the Miocene epoch a broad channel separated North and South America; and it seems
  probable that a series of elevations and subsidences have taken place uniting and separating them
  at different epochs; the most recent submersion having lasted but a short time, and thus, while
  allowing the passage of abundance of locomotive fishes, not admitting of much change in the
  comparatively stationary mollusca.</p>

  <p><i>The Glacial Epoch as affecting the Distribution of Animals.</i>&mdash;The remarkable
  refrigeration of climate in the northern hemisphere within the epoch, of existing species, to
  which the term Glacial epoch is applied, together with the changes of level that accompanied and
  perhaps assisted to produce it, has been one of the chief agents in determining many of the
  details of the existing distribution of animals in temperate zones. A comparison of the effects
  produced by existing glaciers with certain superficial phenomena in the temperate parts of Europe
  and North America, renders it certain that between the Newer Pliocene and the Recent epochs, a
  large portion of the northern hemisphere must have been covered with a sheet of ice several
  thousand feet thick, like that which now envelopes the interior of Greenland. Much further south
  the mountains were covered with perpetual snow, and sent glaciers down every valley; and all the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page41">{41}</span>great valleys on the southern side of the Alps poured
  down streams of ice which stretched far out into the plains of Northern Italy, and have left their
  débris in the form of huge mountainous moraines, in some cases more than a thousand feet high. In
  Canada and New Hampshire the marks of moving ice are found on the tops of mountains from 3,000 to
  5,000 feet high; and the whole surface of the country around and to the north of the great lakes
  is scored by glaciers. Wherever the land was submerged during a part of this cold period, a
  deposit called boulder-clay, or glacial-drift has been formed. This is a mass of sand, clay, or
  gravel, full of angular or rounded stones of all sizes, up to huge blocks as large as a cottage;
  and especially characterized by these stones being distributed confusedly through it, the largest
  being as often near the top as near the bottom, and never sorted into layers of different sizes as
  in materials carried by water. Such deposits are known to be formed by glaciers and icebergs; when
  deposited on the land by glaciers they form moraines, when carried into water and thus spread with
  more regularity over a wider area they form drift. This drift is rarely found except where there
  is other evidence of ice-action, and never south of the 40th parallel of latitude, to which in the
  northern hemisphere signs of ice-action extend. In the southern hemisphere, in Patagonia and in
  New Zealand, exactly similar phenomena occur.</p>

  <p>A very interesting confirmation of the reality of this cold epoch is derived from the study of
  fossil remains. Both the plants and animals of the Miocene period indicate that the climate of
  Central Europe was decidedly warmer or more equable than it is now; since the flora closely
  resembled that of the Southern United States, with a likeness also to that of Eastern Asia and
  Australia. Many of the shells were of tropical genera; and there were numbers of large mammalia
  allied to the elephant, rhinoceros, and tapir. At the same time, or perhaps somewhat earlier, a
  temperate climate extended into the arctic regions, and allowed a magnificent vegetation of shrubs
  and forest trees, some of them evergreen, to flourish within twelve degrees of the Pole. In the
  Pliocene period we find ourselves <span class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>among forms
  implying a climate very little different from the present; and our own Crag formation furnishes
  evidence of a gradual refrigeration of climate; since its three divisions, the Coralline, Red, and
  Norwich Crags, show a decreasing number of southern, and an increasing number of northern species,
  as we approach the Glacial epoch. Still later than these we have the shells of the drift, almost
  all of which are northern and many of them arctic species. Among the mammalia indicative of cold,
  are the mammoth and the reindeer. In gravels and cave-deposits of Post-Pliocene date we find the
  same two animals, which soon disappear as the climate approached its present condition; and
  Professor Forbes has given a list of fifty shells which inhabited the British seas before the
  Glacial epoch and inhabit it still, but are all wanting in the glacial deposits. The whole of
  these are found in the Newer Pliocene strata of Sicily and the south of Europe, where they escaped
  destruction during the glacial winter.</p>

  <p>There are also certain facts in the distribution of plants, which are so well explained by the
  Glacial epoch that they may be said to give an additional confirmation to it. All over the
  northern hemisphere within the glaciated districts, the summits of lofty mountains produce plants
  identical with those of the polar regions. In the celebrated case of the White Mountains in New
  Hampshire, United States (latitude 45°), all the plants on the summit are arctic species, none of
  which exist in the lowlands for near a thousand miles further north. It has also been remarked
  that the plants of each mountain are more especially related to those of the countries directly
  north of it. Thus, those of the Pyrenees and of Scotland are Scandinavian, and those of the White
  Mountains are all species found in Labrador. Now, remembering that we have evidence of an
  exceedingly mild and uniform climate in the arctic regions during the Miocene period and a gradual
  refrigeration from that time, it is evident that with each degree of change more and more hardy
  plants would be successively driven southwards; till at last the plains of the temperate zone
  would be inhabited by plants, which were once confined to alpine heights or to the arctic regions.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page43">{43}</span>As the icy mantle gradually melted off the face of
  the earth these plants would occupy the newly exposed soil, and would thus necessarily travel in
  two directions, back towards the arctic circle and up towards the alpine peaks. The facts are thus
  exactly explained by a cause which independent evidence has proved to be a real one, and every
  such explanation is an additional proof of the reality of the cause. But this explanation implies,
  that in cases where the Glacial epoch cannot have so acted alpine plants should not be northern
  plants; and a striking proof of this is to be found on the Peak of Teneriffe, a mountain 12,000
  feet high. In the uppermost 4,500 feet of this mountain above the limit of trees, Von Buch found
  only eleven species of plants, eight of which were peculiar; but the whole were allied to those
  found at lower elevations. On the Alps or Pyrenees at this elevation, there would be a rich flora
  comprising hundreds of arctic plants; and the absence of anything corresponding to them in this
  case, in which their ingress was cut off by the sea, is exactly what the theory leads us to
  expect.</p>

  <p><i>Changes of Vegetation as affecting the Distribution of Animals.</i>&mdash;As so many animals
  are dependent on vegetation, its changes immediately affect their distribution. A remarkable
  example of this is afforded by the pre-historic condition of Denmark, as interpreted by means of
  the peat-bogs and kitchen-middens. This country is now celebrated for its beech-trees; oaks and
  pines being scarce; and it is known to have had the same vegetation in the time of the Romans. In
  the peat-bogs, however, are found deposits of oak trees; and deeper still pines alone occur. Now
  the kitchen-middens tell us much of the natural history of Denmark in the early Stone period; and
  a curious confirmation of the fact that Denmark like Norway was then chiefly covered with pine
  forests is obtained by the discovery, that the Capercailzie was then abundant, a bird which feeds
  almost exclusively on the young shoots and seeds of pines and allied plants. The cause of this
  change in the vegetation is unknown; but from the known fact that when forests are destroyed
  trees, of a different kind usually occupy the ground, we may suppose that some such change as a
  temporary submergence might cause an entirely <span class="pagenum"
  id="page44">{44}</span>different vegetation and a considerably modified fauna to occupy the
  country.</p>

  <p><i>Organic Changes as affecting Distribution.</i>&mdash;We have now briefly touched on some of
  the direct effects of changes in physical geography, climate, and vegetation, on the distribution
  of animals; but the indirect effects of such changes are probably of quite equal, if not of
  greater importance. Every change becomes the centre of an ever-widening circle of effects. The
  different members of the organic world are so bound together by complex relations, that any one
  change generally involves numerous other changes, often of the most unexpected kind. We know
  comparatively little of the way in which one animal or plant is bound up with others, but we know
  enough to assure us that groups the most apparently disconnected are often dependent on each
  other. We know, for example, that the introduction of goats into St. Helena utterly destroyed a
  whole flora of forest trees; and with them all the insects, mollusca, and perhaps birds directly
  or indirectly dependent on them. Swine, which ran wild in Mauritius, exterminated the Dodo. The
  same animals are known to be the greatest enemies of venomous serpents. Cattle will, in many
  districts, wholly prevent the growth of trees; and with the trees the numerous insects dependent
  on those trees, and the birds which fed upon the insects, must disappear, as well as the small
  mammalia which feed on the fruits, seeds, leaves, or roots. Insects again have the most wonderful
  influence on the range of mammalia. In Paraguay a certain species of fly abounds which destroys
  new-born cattle and horses; and thus neither of these animals have run wild in that country,
  although they abound both north and south of it. This inevitably leads to a great difference in
  the vegetation of Paraguay, and through that to a difference in its insects, birds, reptiles, and
  wild mammalia. On what causes the existence of the fly depends we do not know, but it is not
  improbable that some comparatively slight changes in the temperature or humidity of the air at a
  particular season, or the introduction of some enemy might lead to its extinction or banishment.
  The whole face of the country would then soon be changed: new species would <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45">{45}</span>come in, while many others would be unable to live there; and the immediate
  cause of this great alteration would probably be quite imperceptible to us, even if we could watch
  it in progress year by year. So, in South Africa, the celebrated Tsetse fly inhabits certain
  districts having well defined limits; and where it abounds no horses, dogs, or cattle can live.
  Yet asses, zebras, and antelopes are unaffected by it. So long as this fly continues to exist,
  there is a living barrier to the entrance of certain animals, quite as effectual as a lofty
  mountain range or a wide arm of the sea. The complex relations of one form of life with others is
  nowhere better illustrated than in Mr. Darwin's celebrated case of the cats and clover, as given
  in his <i>Origin of Species</i>, 6th ed., p. 57. He has observed that both wild heartsease and
  red-clover are fertilized in this country by humble-bees only, so that the production of seed
  depends on the visits of these insects. A gentleman who has specially studied humble-bees finds
  that they are largely kept down by field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests. Field-mice in
  their turn are kept down by cats; and probably also by owls; so that these carnivorous animals are
  really the agents in rendering possible the continued existence of red-clover and wild heartsease.
  For if they were absent, the field-mice having no enemies, would multiply to such an extent as to
  destroy all the humble-bees; and these two plants would then produce no seed and soon become
  extinct.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin has also shown that one species often exterminates another closely allied to it,
  when the two are brought into contact. One species of swallow and thrush are known to have
  increased at the expense of allied species. Rats, carried all over the world by commerce, are
  continually extirpating other species of rats. The imported hive-bee is, in Australia, rapidly
  exterminating a native stingless bee. Any slight change, therefore, of physical geography or of
  climate, which allows allied species hitherto inhabiting distinct areas to come into contact, will
  often lead to the extermination of one of them; and this extermination will be effected by no
  external force, by no actual enemy, but merely because the one is slightly better <span
  class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span>adapted to live, to increase, and to maintain itself under
  adverse circumstances, than the other.</p>

  <p>Now if we consider carefully the few suggestive facts here referred to (and many others of like
  import are to be found in Mr. Darwin's various works), we shall be led to conclude that the
  several species, genera, families, and orders, both of animals and vegetables which inhabit any
  extensive region, are bound together by a series of complex relations; so that the increase,
  diminution, or extermination of any one, may set in motion a series of actions and reactions more
  or less affecting a large portion of the whole, and requiring perhaps centuries of fluctuation
  before the balance is restored. The range of any species or group in such a region, will in many
  cases (perhaps in most) be determined, not by physical barriers, but by the competition of other
  organisms. Where barriers have existed from a remote epoch, they will at first have kept back
  certain animals from coming in contact with each other; but when the assemblage of organisms on
  the two sides of the barrier have, after many ages, come to form a balanced organic whole, the
  destruction of the barrier may lead to a very partial intermingling of the peculiar forms of the
  two regions. Each will have become modified in special ways adapted to the organic and physical
  conditions of the country, and will form a living barrier to the entrance of animals less
  perfectly adapted to those conditions. Thus while the abolition of ancient barriers will always
  lead to much intermixture of forms, much extermination and wide-spread alteration in some families
  of animals; other important groups will be unable materially to alter their range; or they may
  make temporary incursions into the new territory, and be ultimately driven back to very near their
  ancient limits.</p>

  <p>In order to make this somewhat difficult subject more intelligible, it may be well to consider
  the probable effects of certain hypothetical conditions of the earth's surface<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. If the dry land of the globe had been from the first continuous, and nowhere divided up by
  such boundaries as lofty mountain ranges, wide deserts, or arms of the sea, it seems probable that
  none of the larger groups (as <i>orders</i>, <i>tribes</i>, or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page47">{47}</span><i>families</i>,) would have a limited range; but, as is to some extent the
  case in tropical America east of the Andes, every such group would be represented over the whole
  area, by countless minute modifications of form adapted to local conditions.</p>

  <p>2. One great physical barrier would, however, even then exist; the hot equatorial zone would
  divide the faunas and floras of the colder regions of the northern and southern hemispheres from
  any chance of intermixture. This one barrier would be more effectual than it is now, since there
  would be no lofty mountain ranges to serve as a bridge for the partial interchange of northern and
  southern forms.</p>

  <p>3. If such a condition of the earth as here supposed continued for very long periods, we may
  conceive that the action and reaction of the various organisms on each other, combined with the
  influence of very slowly changing physical conditions, would result in an almost perfect organic
  balance, which would be manifested by a great stability in the average numbers, the local range,
  and the peculiar characteristics of every species.</p>

  <p>4. Under such a condition of things it is not improbable that the total number of clearly
  differentiated specific forms might be much greater than it is now, though the number of generic
  and family types might perhaps be less; for dominant species would have had ample time to spread
  into every locality where they could exist, and would then become everywhere modified into forms
  best suited to the permanent local conditions.</p>

  <p>5. Now let us consider what would be the probable effect of the introduction of a barrier,
  cutting off a portion of this homogeneous and well-balanced world. Suppose, for instance, that a
  subsidence took place, cutting off by a wide arm of the sea a large and tolerably varied island.
  The first and most obvious result would be that the individuals of a number of species would be
  divided into two portions, while others, the limits of whose range agreed approximately with the
  line of subsidence, would exist in unimpaired numbers on the new island or on the main land. But
  the species whose numbers were diminished and whose original area was also absolutely diminished
  by the portion now under the sea, would not be able to hold their <span class="pagenum"
  id="page48">{48}</span>ground against the rival forms whose numbers were intact. Some would
  probably diminish and rapidly die out; others which produced favourable varieties, might be so
  modified by natural selection as to maintain their existence under a different form; and such
  changes would take place in varying modes on the two sides of the new strait.</p>

  <p>6. But the progress of these changes would necessarily affect the other species in contact with
  them. New places would be opened in the economy of nature which many would struggle to obtain; and
  modification would go on in ever-widening circles and very long periods of time might be required
  to bring the whole again into a state of equilibrium.</p>

  <p>7. A new set of factors would in the meantime have come into play. The sinking of land and the
  influx of a large body of water could hardly take place without producing important climatal
  changes. The temperature, the winds, the rains, might all be affected, and more or less changed in
  duration and amount. This would lead to a quite distinct movement in the organic world. Vegetation
  would certainly be considerably affected, and through this the insect tribes. We have seen how
  closely the life of the higher animals is often bound up with that of insects; and thus a set of
  changes might arise that would modify the numerical proportions, and even the forms and habits of
  a great number of species, would completely exterminate some, and raise others from a subordinate
  to a dominant position. And all these changes would occur differently on opposite sides of the
  strait, since the insular climate could not fail to differ considerably from that of the
  continent.</p>

  <p>8. But the two sets of changes, as above indicated, produced by different modes of action of
  the same primary cause, would act and react on each other; and thus lead to such a far-spreading
  disturbance of the organic equilibrium as ultimately perhaps to affect in one way or another,
  every form of life upon the earth.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This hypothetical case is useful as enabling us better to realize how
  wide-spreading might be the effects of one of the simplest changes of physical geography, upon a
  compact mass of mutually <span class="pagenum" id="page49">{49}</span>adapted organisms. In the
  actual state of things, the physical changes that occur and have occurred through all geological
  epochs are larger and more varied. Almost every mile of land surface has been again and again
  depressed beneath the ocean; most of the great mountain chains have either originated or greatly
  increased in height during the Tertiary period; marvellous alterations of climate and vegetation
  have taken place over half the land-surface of the earth; and all these vast changes have
  influenced a globe so cut up by seas and oceans, by deserts and snow-clad mountains, that in many
  of its more isolated land-masses ancient forms of life have been preserved, which, in the more
  extensive and more varied continents have long given way to higher types. How complex then must
  have been the actions and reactions such a state of things would bring about; and how impossible
  must it be for us to guess, in most cases, at the exact nature of the forces that limit the range
  of some species and cause others to be rare or to become extinct! All that we can in general hope
  to do is, to trace out, more or less hypothetically, some of the larger changes in physical
  geography that have occurred during the ages immediately preceeding our own, and to estimate the
  effect they will probably have produced on animal distribution. We may then, by the aid of such
  knowledge as to past organic mutations as the geological record supplies us with, be able to
  determine the probable birthplace and subsequent migrations of the more important genera and
  families; and thus obtain some conception of that grand series of co-ordinated changes in the
  earth and its inhabitants, whose final result is seen in the forms and the geographical
  distribution of existing animals.</p>

  ZOOLOGICAL REGIONS.</span></span></p>

  <p>To the older school of Naturalists the native country of an animal was of little importance,
  except in as far as climates differed. Animals were supposed to be specially adapted to live in
  certain zones or under certain physical conditions, and it was hardly recognised that apart from
  these conditions there was any influence in locality which could materially affect them. It was
  believed that, while the animals of tropical, temperate, and arctic climates, essentially
  differed; those of the tropics were essentially alike all over the world. A group of animals was
  said to inhabit the "Indies;" and important differences of structure were often overlooked from
  the idea, that creatures equally adapted to live in hot countries and with certain general
  resemblances, would naturally be related to each other. Thus the Toucans and Hornbills, the
  Humming-Birds and Sun-Birds, and even the Tapirs and the Elephants, came to be popularly
  associated as slightly modified varieties of tropical forms of life; while to naturalists, who
  were acquainted with the essential differences of structure, it was a never-failing source of
  surprise, that under climates and conditions so apparently identical, such strangely divergent
  forms should be produced.</p>

  <p>To the modern naturalist, on the other hand, the native country (or "habitat" as it is
  technically termed) of an animal <span class="pagenum" id="page51">{51}</span>or a group of
  animals, is a matter of the first importance; and, as regards the general history of life upon the
  globe, may be considered to be one of its essential characters. The structure, affinities, and
  habits of a species, now form only a part of its natural history. We require also to know its
  exact range at the present day and in prehistoric times, and to have some knowledge of its
  geological age, the place of its earliest appearance on the globe, and of the various extinct
  forms most nearly allied to it. To those who accept the theory of development as worked out by Mr.
  Darwin, and the views as to the general permanence and immense antiquity of the great continents
  and oceans so ably developed by Sir Charles Lyell, it ceases to be a matter of surprise that the
  tropics of Africa, Asia, and America should differ in their productions, but rather that they
  should have anything in common. Their similarity, not their diversity, is the fact that most
  frequently puzzles us.</p>

  <p>The more accurate knowledge we have of late years obtained of the productions of many remote
  regions, combined with the greater approaches that have been made to a natural classification of
  the higher animals, has shown, that every continent or well-marked division of a continent, every
  archipelago and even every island, presents problems of more or less complexity to the student of
  the geographical distribution of animals. If we take up the subject from the zoological side, and
  study any family, order, or even extensive genus, we are almost sure to meet with some anomalies
  either in the present or past distribution of the various forms. Let us adduce a few examples of
  these problems.</p>

  <p>Deer have a wonderfully wide range, over the whole of Europe, Asia, and North and South
  America; yet in Africa south of the great desert there are none. Bears range over the whole of
  Europe, Asia, and North America, and true pigs of the genus Sus, over all Europe and Asia and as
  far as New Guinea; yet both bears and pigs, like deer, are absent from Tropical and South
  Africa.</p>

  <p>Again, the West Indian islands possess very few Mammalia, all of small size and allied to those
  of America, except one <span class="pagenum" id="page52">{52}</span>genus; and that belongs to an
  Order, "Insectivora," entirely absent from South America, and to a family, "Centetidæ," all the
  other species of which inhabit Madagascar only. And as if to add force to this singular
  correspondence we have one Madagascar species of a beautiful day-flying Moth, <i>Urania</i>, all
  the other species of which inhabit tropical America. These insects are gorgeously arrayed in green
  and gold, and are quite unlike any other Lepidoptera upon the globe.</p>

  <p>The island of Ceylon generally agrees in its productions with the Southern part of India; yet
  it has several birds which are allied to Malayan and not to Indian groups, and a fine butterfly of
  the genus <i>Hestia</i>, as well as several genera of beetles, which are purely Malayan.</p>

  <p>Various important groups of animals are distributed in a way not easy to explain. The
  anthropoid apes in West Africa and Borneo; the tapirs in Malaya and South America; the camel tribe
  in the deserts of Asia and the Andes; the trogons in South America and Tropical Asia, with one
  species in Africa; the marsupials in Australia and America, are examples.</p>

  <p>The cases here adduced (and they might be greatly multiplied) are merely to show the kind of
  problems with which the naturalist now has to deal; and in order to do so he requires some system
  of geographical arrangement, which shall serve the double purpose of affording a convenient
  subdivision of his subject, and at the same time of giving expression to the main results at which
  he has arrived. Hence the recent discussions on "Zoological Regions," or, what are the most
  natural primary divisions of the earth as regards its forms of animal life.</p>

  <p>The divisions in use till quite recently were of two kinds; either those ready made by
  geographers, more especially the quarters or continents of the globe; or those determined by
  climate and marked out by certain parallels of latitude or by isothermal lines. Either of these
  methods was better than none at all; but from the various considerations explained in the
  preceding chapters, it will be evident, that such divisions must have often been very unnatural,
  and have disguised many <span class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span>of the most important and
  interesting phenomena which a study of the distribution of animals presents to us.</p>

  <p>The merit of initiating a more natural system, that of determining zoological regions, not by
  any arbitrary or <i>a priori</i> consideration but by studying the actual ranges of the more
  important groups of animals, is due to Mr. Sclater, who, in 1857, established six primary
  zoological regions from a detailed examination of the distribution of the chief genera and
  families of Birds. Before stating what these regions are, what objections have been made to them,
  what other divisions have been since proposed, and what are those which we shall adopt in this
  work, it will be well to consider the general principles which should guide us in the choice
  between rival systems.</p>

  <p><i>Principles on which Zoological Regions should be formed.</i>&mdash;It will be evident in the
  first place that nothing like a perfect zoological division of the earth is possible. The causes
  that have led to the present distribution of animal life are so varied, their action and reaction
  have been so complex, that anomalies and irregularities are sure to exist which will mar the
  symmetry of any rigid system. On two main points every system yet proposed, or that probably can
  be proposed, is open to objection; they are,&mdash;1stly, that the several regions are not of
  equal rank;&mdash;2ndly, that they are not equally applicable to all classes of animals. As to the
  first objection, it will be found impossible to form any three or more regions, each of which
  differs from the rest in an equal degree or in the same manner. One will surpass all others in the
  possession of peculiar families; another will have many characteristic genera; while a third will
  be mainly distinguished by negative characters. There will also be found many intermediate
  districts, which possess some of the characteristics of two well-marked regions, with a few
  special features of their own, or perhaps with none; and it will be a difficult question to decide
  in all cases which region should possess this doubtful territory, or whether it should be formed
  into a primary region itself. Again, two regions which have now well-marked points of difference,
  may be shown to have been much more alike at a comparatively recent geological epoch; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page54">{54}</span>and this, it may be said, proves their fundamental unity
  and that they ought to form but one primary region. To obviate some of these difficulties a binary
  or dichotomous division is sometimes proposed; that portion of the earth which differs most from
  the rest being cut off as a region equal in rank to all that remains, which is subjected again and
  again to the same process.</p>

  <p>To decide these various points it seems advisable that convenience, intelligibility, and
  custom, should largely guide us. The first essential is, a broadly marked and easily remembered
  set of regions; which correspond, as nearly as truth to nature will allow, with the distribution
  of the most important groups of animals. What these groups are we shall presently explain. In
  determining the number, extent, and boundaries of these regions, we must be guided by a variety of
  indications, since the application of fixed rules is impossible. They should evidently be of a
  moderate number, corresponding as far as practicable with the great natural divisions of the globe
  marked out by nature, and which have always been recognized by geographers. There should be some
  approximation to equality of size, since there is reason to believe that a tolerably extensive
  area has been an essential condition for the development of most animal forms; and it is found
  that, other things being equal, the numbers, variety and importance of the forms of animal and
  vegetable life, do bear some approximate relation to extent of area. Although the possession of
  peculiar families or genera is the main character of a primary zoological region, yet the negative
  character of the absence of certain families or genera is of equal importance, <i>when this
  absence does not manifestly depend on unsuitability to the support of the group</i>, and
  especially <i>when there is now no physical barrier preventing their entrance</i>. This will
  become evident when we consider that the importance of the possession of a group by one region
  depends on its absence from the adjoining regions; and if there is now no barrier to its entrance,
  we may be sure that there has once been one; and that the possession of the area by a distinct and
  well balanced set of organisms, which must have been slowly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page55">{55}</span>developed and adjusted, is the living barrier that now keeps out
  intruders.</p>

  <p>When it is ascertained that the chief differences which now obtain between two areas did not
  exist in Miocene or Pliocene times, the fact is one of great interest, and enables us to speculate
  with some degree of probability as to the causes that have brought about the present state of
  things; but it is not a reason for uniting these two areas into one region. Our object is to
  represent as nearly as possible the main features of the distribution of existing animals, not
  those of any or all past geological epochs. Should we ever obtain sufficient information as to the
  geography and biology of the earth at past epochs, we might indeed determine approximately what
  were the Pliocene or Miocene or Eocene zoological regions; but any attempt to exhibit all these in
  combination with those of our own period, must lead to confusion.</p>

  <p>The binary or dichotomous system, although it brings out the fundamental differences of the
  respective regions, is an inconvenient one in its application, and rather increases than obviates
  the difficulty as to equality or inequality of regions; for although <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
  and <i>d</i>, may be areas of unequal zoological rank, <i>a</i> being the most important, and
  <i>d</i> the least, yet this inequality will probably be still greater if we first divide them
  into <i>a</i>, on one side, and <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, on the other, and then, by
  another division, make <i>b</i>, an area of the second, and <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, of the third
  rank only.</p>

  <p>Coming to the second objection, the often incompatible distribution of different groups of
  animals, affords ground for opposition to any proposed scheme of zoological regions. There is
  first the radical difference between land and sea animals; the most complete barriers to the
  dispersal of the one, sometimes offering the greatest facilities for the emigration of the other,
  and <i>vice versa</i>. A large number of marine animals, however, frequent shallow water only; and
  these, keeping near the coasts, will agree generally in their distribution with those inhabiting
  the land. But among land animals themselves there are very great differences of distribution, due
  to certain specialities <span class="pagenum" id="page56">{56}</span>in their organization or mode
  of life. These act mainly in two ways,&mdash;1stly, by affecting the facilities with which they
  can be dispersed, either voluntarily or involuntarily;&mdash;2ndly, by the conditions which enable
  them to multiply and establish themselves in certain areas and not in others. When both these
  means of diffusion are at a maximum, the dispersal of a group becomes universal, and ceases to
  have much interest for us. This is the case with certain groups of fungi and lichens, as well as
  with some of the lower animals; and in a less degree, as has been shown by Mr. Darwin, with many
  fresh-water plants and animals. At the other extreme we may place certain arboreal vertebrata such
  as sloths and lemurs, which have no means of passing such barriers as narrow straits or moderately
  high mountains, and whose survival in any new country they might reach, would be dependent on the
  presence of suitable forests and the absence of dangerous enemies. Almost equally, or perhaps even
  more restricted, are the means of permanent diffusion of terrestrial molluscs; since these are
  without any but very rare and accidental means of being safely transported across the sea; their
  individual powers of locomotion are highly restricted; they are especially subject to the attacks
  of enemies; and they often depend not only on a peculiar vegetation, but on the geological
  character of the country, their abundance being almost in direct proportion to the presence of
  some form of calcareous rocks. Between these extremes we find animals possessed of an infinite
  gradation of powers to disperse and to maintain themselves; and it will evidently be impossible
  that the limits which best define the distribution of one group, should be equally true for all
  others.</p>

  <p><i>Which class of Animals is of most importance in determining Zoological Regions.</i>&mdash;To
  decide this question we have to consider which groups of animals are best adapted to exhibit, by
  their existing distribution, the past changes and present physical condition of the earth's
  surface; and at the same time, by the abundance of their remains in the various tertiary
  formations will best enable us to trace out the more recent of the series of changes, both of the
  earth's surface and <span class="pagenum" id="page57">{57}</span>of its inhabitants, by which the
  present state of things has been brought about. For this purpose we require a group which shall be
  dependent for its means of dispersal on the distribution of land and water, and on the presence or
  absence of lofty mountains, desert plains or plateaux, and great forests; since these are the
  chief physical features of the earth's surface whose modifications at successive periods we wish
  to discover. It is also essential that they should not be subject to dispersal by many accidental
  causes; as this would inevitably in time tend to obliterate the effect of natural barriers, and
  produce a scattered distribution, the causes of which we could only guess at. Again, it is
  necessary that they should be so highly organized as not to be absolutely dependent on other
  groups of animals, and with so much power of adaptation as to be able to exist in one form or
  another over the whole globe. And lastly, it is highly important that the whole group should be
  pretty well known, and that a fairly natural classification, especially of its minor divisions
  such as families and genera, should have been arrived at; the reason for which last proviso is
  explained in our next chapter, on classification.</p>

  <p>Now in every one of these points the mammalia are preeminent; and they possess the additional
  advantage of being the most highly developed class of organized beings, and that to which we
  ourselves belong. We should therefore construct our typical or standard Zoological Regions in the
  first place, from a consideration of the distribution of mammalia, only bringing to our aid the
  distribution of other groups to determine doubtful points. Regions so established will be most
  closely in accordance with those long-enduring features of physical geography, on which the
  distribution of all forms of life fundamentally depend; and all discrepancies in the distribution
  of other classes of animals must be capable of being explained, either by their exceptional means
  of dispersion or by special conditions affecting their perpetuation and increase in each
  locality.</p>

  <p>If these considerations are well founded, the objections of those who study insects or
  molluscs, for example,&mdash;that our regions are not true for their departments of
  nature&mdash;cannot be <span class="pagenum" id="page58">{58}</span>maintained. For they will
  find, that a careful consideration of the exceptional means of dispersal and conditions of
  existence of each group, will explain most of the divergences from the normal distribution of
  higher animals.</p>

  <p>We shall thus be led to an intelligent comprehension of the phenomena of distribution in all
  groups, which would not be the case if every specialist formed regions for his own particular
  study. In many cases we should find that no satisfactory division of the earth could be made to
  correspond with the distribution even of an entire class; but we should have the coleopterist and
  the lepidopterist each with his own Geography. And even this would probably not suffice, for it is
  very doubtful if the detailed distribution of the Longicornes, so closely dependent on woody
  vegetation, could be made to agree with that of the Staphylinidæ or the Carabidæ which abound in
  many of the most barren regions, or with that of the Scarabeidæ, largely dependent on the presence
  of herbivorous mammalia. And when each of these enquirers had settled a division of the earth into
  "regions" which exhibited with tolerable accuracy the phenomena of distribution of his own group,
  we should have gained nothing whatever but a very complex mode of exhibiting the bare facts of
  distribution. We should then have to begin to work out the causes of the divergence of one group
  from another in this respect; but as each worker would refer to his own set of regions as the
  type, the whole subject would become involved in inextricable confusion. These considerations seem
  to make it imperative that one set of "regions" should be established as typical for Zoology; and
  it is hoped the reasons here advanced will satisfy most naturalists that these regions can be best
  determined, in the first place, by a study of the distribution of the mammalia, supplemented in
  doubtful cases by that of the other vertebrates. We will now proceed to a discussion of what these
  regions are.</p>

  <p><i>Various Zoological Regions proposed since 1857.</i>&mdash;It has already been pointed out
  that a very large number of birds are limited by the same kind of barriers as mammalia; it will
  therefore not be surprising that a system of regions formed to suit the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page59">{59}</span>one, should very nearly represent the distribution of the other. Mr.
  Sclater's regions are as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The Palæarctic Region; including Europe, Temperate Asia, and N. Africa to the Atlas
  mountains.</p>

  <p>2. The Ethiopian Region; Africa south of the Atlas, Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands, with
  Southern Arabia.</p>

  <p>3. The Indian Region; including India south of the Himalayas, to South China, and to Borneo and
  Java.</p>

  <p>4. The Australian Region; including Celebes and Lombock, eastward to Australia and the Pacific
  Islands.</p>

  <p>5. The Nearctic Region; including Greenland, and N. America, to Northern Mexico.</p>

  <p>6. The Neotropical Region; including South America, the Antilles, and Southern Mexico.</p>

  <p>This division of the earth received great support from Dr. Günther, who, in the <i>Proceedings
  of the Zoological Society</i> for 1858, showed that the geographical distribution of Reptiles
  agreed with it very closely, the principal difference being that the reptiles of Japan have a more
  Indian character than the birds, this being especially the case with the snakes. In the volume for
  1868 of the same work, Professor Huxley discusses at considerable length the primary and secondary
  zoological divisions of the earth. He gives reasons for thinking that the most radical primary
  division, both as regards birds and mammals, is into a Northern and Southern hemisphere (Arctogæa
  and Notogæa), the former, however, embracing all Africa, while the latter includes only
  Australasia and the Neotropical or Austro-Columbian region. Mr. Sclater had grouped his regions
  primarily into Palæogæa and Neogæa, the Old and New Worlds of geographers; a division which
  strikingly accords with the distribution of the passerine birds, but not so well with that of
  mammalia or reptiles. Professor Huxley points out that the Nearctic, Palæarctic, Indian, and
  Ethiopian regions of Mr. Sclater have a much greater resemblance to each other than any one of
  them has to Australia or to South America; and he further suggests that New Zealand alone has
  peculiarities which might entitle it to rank as a primary region <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60">{60}</span>along with Australasia and South America; and that a Circumpolar Province
  might be conveniently recognised as of equal rank with the Palæarctic and Nearctic provinces.</p>

  <p>In 1866, Mr. Andrew Murray published a large and copiously illustrated volume on the
  <i>Geographical Distribution of Mammals</i>, in which he maintains that the great and primary
  mammalian regions are only four: 1st. The Palæarctic region of Mr. Sclater, extended to include
  the Sahara and Nubia; 2nd. the Indo-African region, including the Indian and Ethiopian regions of
  Mr. Sclater; 3rd. the Australian region (unaltered); 4th. the American region, including both
  North and South America. These are the regions as <i>described</i> by Mr. Murray, but his coloured
  map of "Great Mammalian Regions" shows all Arctic America to a little south of the Isothermal of
  32° Fahr. as forming with Europe and North Asia one great region.</p>

  <p>At the meeting of the British Association at Exeter in 1869, Mr. W. T. Blanford read a paper on
  the Fauna of British India, in which he maintained that a large portion of the peninsula of India
  had derived its Fauna mainly from Africa; and that the term "Indian region" of Mr. Sclater was
  misleading, because India proper, if it belongs to it at all, is the least typical portion of it.
  He therefore proposes to call it the "Malayan region," because in the Malay countries it is most
  highly developed. Ceylon and the mountain ranges of Southern India have marked Malay
  affinities.</p>

  <p>In 1871 Mr. E. Blyth published in <i>Nature</i> "A suggested new Division of the Earth into
  Zoological Regions," in which he indicates seven primary divisions or regions, subdivided into
  twenty-six sub-regions. The seven regions are defined as follows: 1. The Boreal region; including
  the whole of the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions of Mr. Sclater along with the West Indies,
  Central America, the whole chain of the Andes, with Chili and Patagonia. 2. The Columbian region;
  consisting of the remaining part of South America. 3. The Ethiopian region; comprising besides
  that region of Mr. Sclater, the valley of the Jordan, Arabia, and the desert country towards
  India, with all the plains and table lands of India and the northern <span class="pagenum"
  id="page61">{61}</span>half of Ceylon. 4. The Lemurian region; consisting of Madagascar and its
  adjacent islands. 5. The Austral-Asian region; which is the Indian region of Mr. Sclater without
  the portion taken to be added to the Ethiopian region. 6. The Melanesian region; which is the
  Australian region of Mr. Sclater without New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, which form 7. the
  Polynesian region. Mr. Blyth thinks this is "a true classification of zoological regions as
  regards mammalia and birds."</p>

  <p>In an elaborate paper on the birds of Eastern North America, their distribution and migrations
  (<i>Bulletin of Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts</i>, Vol. 2), Mr. J. A.
  Allen proposes a division of the earth in accordance with what he terms, "the law of circumpolar
  distribution of life in zones," as follows: 1. Arctic realm. 2. North temperate realm. 3. American
  tropical realm. 4. Indo-African tropical realm. 5. South American tropical realm. 6. African
  temperate realm. 7. Antarctic realm. 8. Australian realm. Some of these are subdivided into
  regions; (2) consisting of the American and the Europæo-Asiatic regions; (4) into the African and
  Indian regions; (8) into the tropical Australian region, and one comprising the southern part of
  Australia and New Zealand. The other realms each form a single region.</p>

  <p><i>Discussion of proposed Regions.</i>&mdash;Before proceeding to define the regions adopted in
  this work, it may be as well to make a few remarks on some of the preceding classifications, and
  to give the reasons which seem to render it advisable to adopt very few of the suggested
  improvements on Mr. Sclater's original proposal. Mr. Blyth's scheme is one of the least natural,
  and also the most inconvenient. There can be little use in the knowledge that a group of animals
  is found in the Boreal Region, if their habitat might still be either Patagonia, the West Indies,
  or Japan; and it is difficult to see on what principle the Madagascar group of islands is made of
  equal rank with this enormous region, seeing that its forms of life have marked African
  affinities. Neither does it seem advisable to adopt the Polynesian Region, or that comprising New
  Zealand alone (as hinted at by Professor Huxley and since adopted by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page62">{62}</span>Mr. Sclater in his Lectures on Geographical Distribution at the Zoological
  Gardens in May 1874), because it is absolutely without indigenous mammalia and very poor in all
  forms of life, and therefore by no means prominent or important enough to form a primary region of
  the earth.</p>

  <p>It may be as well here to notice what appears to be a serious objection to making New Zealand,
  or any similar isolated district, one of the great zoological regions, comparable to South
  America, Australia, or Ethiopia; which is, that its claim to that distinction rests on grounds
  which are liable to fail. It is because New Zealand, in addition to its negative merits, possesses
  three families of birds (Apterygidæ living, Dinornithidæ and Palapterygidæ extinct), and a
  peculiar lizard-like reptile, <i>Hatteria</i>, which has to be classed in a distinct order,
  Rhynchocephalina, that the rank of a Region is claimed for it. But supposing, what is not at all
  improbable, that other Rhynchocephalina should be discovered in the interior of Australia or in
  New Guinea, and that Apterygidæ or Palapterygidæ should be found to have inhabited Australia in
  Post-Pliocene times, (as Dinornithidæ have already been proved to have done) the claims of New
  Zealand would entirely fail, and it would be universally acknowledged to be a part of the great
  Australian region. No such reversal can take place in the case of the other regions; because they
  rest, not upon one or two, but upon a large number of peculiarities, of such a nature that there
  is no room upon the globe for discoveries that can seriously modify them. Even if one or two
  peculiar types, like Apterygidæ or <i>Hatteria</i>, should permanently remain characteristic of
  New Zealand alone, we can account for these by the extreme isolation of the country, and the
  absence of enemies, which have enabled these defenceless birds and reptiles to continue their
  existence; just as the isolation and protection of the caverns of Carniola have enabled the
  <i>Proteus</i> to survive in Europe. But supposing that the <i>Proteus</i> was the sole
  representative of an order of Batrachia, and that two or three other equally curious and isolated
  forms occurred with it, no one would propose that these caverns or the district containing them,
  should form one of the <span class="pagenum" id="page63">{63}</span>primary divisions of the
  earth. Neither can much stress be laid on the negative characteristics of New Zealand, since they
  are found to an almost equal extent in every oceanic island.</p>

  <p>Again, it is both inconvenient and misleading to pick out certain tracts from the midst of one
  region or sub-region and to place them in another, on account of certain isolated affinities which
  may often be accounted for by local peculiarities. Even if the resemblance of the fauna of Chili
  and Patagonia to that of the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions was much greater than it is, this
  mode of dealing with it would be objectionable; but it is still more so, when we find that these
  countries have a strongly marked South American character, and that the northern affinities are
  altogether exceptional. The Rodentia, which comprise a large portion of the mammalia of these
  countries, are wholly South American in type, and the birds are almost all allied to forms
  characteristic of tropical America.</p>

  <p>For analogous reasons the Ethiopian must not be made to include any part of India or Ceylon;
  for although the Fauna of Central India has some African affinities, these do not preponderate;
  and it will not be difficult to show that to follow Mr. Andrew Murray in uniting bodily the
  Ethiopian and Indian regions of Mr. Sclater, is both unnatural and inconvenient. The resemblances
  between them are of the same character as those which would unite them both with the Palæarctic
  and Nearctic regions; and although it may be admitted, that, as Professor Huxley maintains, this
  group forms one of the great primary divisions of the globe, it is far too extensive and too
  heterogeneous to subserve the practical uses for which we require a division of the world into
  zoological regions.</p>

  <p><i>Reasons for adopting the six Regions first proposed by Mr. Sclater.</i>&mdash;So that we do
  not violate any clear affinities or produce any glaring irregularities, it is a positive, and by
  no means an unimportant, advantage to have our named regions approximately equal in size, and with
  easily defined, and therefore easily remembered, boundaries. All elaborate definitions of
  interpenetrating frontiers, as well as regions extending over three-fourths of the land surface of
  the globe, and including places which are <span class="pagenum" id="page64">{64}</span>the
  antipodes of each other, would be most inconvenient, even if there were not such difference of
  opinion about them. There can be little doubt, for example, that the most radical zoological
  division of the earth is made by separating the Australian region from the rest; but although it
  is something useful and definite to know that a group of animals is peculiar to Australia, it is
  exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory to say of any other group merely that it is extra-Australian.
  Neither can it be said that, from any point of view, these two divisions are of equal importance.
  The next great natural division that can be made is the separation of the Neotropical Region of
  Mr. Sclater from the rest of the world. We thus have three primary divisions, which Professor
  Huxley seems inclined to consider as of tolerably equal zoological importance. But a consideration
  of all the facts, zoological and palæontological, indicates, that the great northern division
  (Arctogæa) is fully as much more important than either Australia or South America, as its four
  component parts are less important; and if so, convenience requires us to adopt the smaller rather
  than the larger divisions.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This question, of comparative importance or equivalence of value, is very difficult
  to determine. It may be considered from the point of view of speciality or isolation, or from that
  of richness and variety of animal forms. In isolation and speciality, determined by what they want
  as well as what they possess, the Australian and Neotropical regions are undoubtedly each
  comparable with the rest of the earth (Arctogæa). But in richness and variety of forms, they are
  both very much inferior, and are much more nearly comparable with the separate regions which
  compose it. Taking the families of mammalia as established by the best authors, and leaving out
  the Cetacea and the Bats, which are almost universally distributed, and about whose classification
  there is much uncertainty, the number of families represented in each of Mr. Sclater's regions is
  as follows:</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page65">{65}</span></div>

  <p>We see, then, that even the exceedingly rich and isolated Neotropical region is less rich and
  diversified in its forms of mammalian life than the very much smaller area of the Indian region,
  or the temperate Palæarctic, and very much less so than the Ethiopian region; while even the
  comparatively poor Nearctic region, is nearly equal to it in the number of its family types. If
  these were united they would possess fifty-five families, a number very disproportionate to those
  of the remaining two. Another consideration is, that although the absence of certain forms of life
  makes a region more isolated, it does not make it zoologically more important; for we have only to
  suppose some five or six families, now common to both, to become extinct either in the Ethiopian
  or the Indian regions, and they would become as strongly differentiated from all other regions as
  South America, while still remaining as rich in family types. In birds exactly the same phenomenon
  recurs, the family types being less numerous in South America than in either of the other tropical
  regions of the earth, but a larger proportion of them are restricted to it. It will be shown
  further on, that the Ethiopian and Indian, (or, as I propose to call it in this work, Oriental)
  regions, are sufficiently differentiated by very important groups of animals peculiar to each; and
  that, on strict zoological principles they are entitled to rank as regions of equal value with the
  Neotropical and Australian. It is perhaps less clear whether the Palæarctic should be separated
  from the Oriental region, with which it has undoubtedly much in common; but there are many and
  powerful reasons for keeping it distinct. There is an unmistakably different facies in the animal
  forms of the two regions; and although no families of mammalia or birds, and not many genera, are
  wholly confined to the Palæarctic region, a very considerable number of both have their metropolis
  in it, and are very richly represented. The distinction between the characteristic forms of life
  in tropical and cold countries is, on the whole, very strongly marked in the northern hemisphere;
  and to refuse to recognise this in a subdivision of the earth which is established for the very
  purpose of expressing such contrasts more clearly and concisely than by ordinary geographical
  terminology, would be both illogical and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page66">{66}</span>inconvenient. The one question then remains, whether the Nearctic region
  should be kept separate, or whether it should form part of the Palæarctic or of the Neotropical
  regions. Professor Huxley and Mr. Blyth advocate the former course; Mr. Andrew Murray (for
  mammalia) and Professor Newton (for birds) think the latter would be more natural. No doubt much
  is to be said for both views, but both cannot be right; and it will be shown in the latter part of
  this chapter that the Nearctic region is, on the whole, fully as well defined as the Palæarctic,
  by positive characters which differentiate it from both the adjacent regions. More evidence in the
  same direction will be found in the Second Part of this work, in which the extinct faunas of the
  several regions are discussed.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A confirmation of the general views here set forth, as to the distinctness and
  approximate equivalence of the six regions, is to be found in the fact, that if any two or more of
  them are combined they themselves become divisions of the next lower rank, or
  "sub-regions;"&mdash;and these will be very much more important, both zoologically and
  geographically, than the subdivisions of the remaining regions. It is admitted then that these six
  regions are by no means of precisely equal rank, and that some of them are far more isolated and
  better characterized than others; but it is maintained that, looked at from every point of view,
  they are more equal in rank than any others that can be formed; while in geographical equality,
  compactness of area, and facility of definition, they are beyond all comparison better than any
  others that have yet been proposed for the purpose of facilitating the study of geographical
  distribution. They may be arranged and grouped as follows, so as to exhibit their various
  relations and affinities.</p>

  <p>The above table shows the regions placed in the order followed in the Fourth Part of this work,
  and the reasons for which are <span class="pagenum" id="page67">{67}</span>explained in Chapter
  IX. As a matter of convenience, and for other reasons adduced in the same chapter, the detailed
  exposition of the geographical distribution of the animals of the several regions in Part III.
  commences with the Palæarctic and terminates with the Nearctic region.</p>

  <p><i>Objections to the system of Circumpolar Zones.</i>&mdash;Mr. Allen's system of "realms"
  founded on climatic zones (given at p. 61), having recently appeared in an ornithological work of
  considerable detail and research, calls for a few remarks. The author continually refers to the
  "<i>law of the distribution of life in circumpolar zones</i>," as if it were one generally
  accepted and that admits of no dispute. But this supposed "law" only applies to the smallest
  details of distribution&mdash;to the range and increasing or decreasing numbers of <i>species</i>
  as we pass from north to south, or the reverse; while it has little bearing on the great features
  of zoological geography&mdash;the limitation of groups of <i>genera</i> and <i>families</i> to
  certain areas. It is analogous to the "<i>law of adaptation</i>" in the organisation of animals,
  by which members of various groups are suited for an aerial, an aquatic, a desert, or an arboreal
  life; are herbivorous, carnivorous, or insectivorous; are fitted to live underground, or in fresh
  waters, or on polar ice. It was once thought that these adaptive peculiarities were suitable
  foundations for a classification,&mdash;that whales were fishes, and bats birds; and even to this
  day there are naturalists who cannot recognise the essential diversity of structure in such groups
  as swifts and swallows, sun-birds and humming-birds, under the superficial disguise caused by
  adaptation to a similar mode of life. The application of Mr. Allen's principle leads to equally
  erroneous results, as may be well seen by considering his separation of "the southern third of
  Australia" to unite it with New Zealand as one of his secondary zoological divisions. If there is
  one country in the world whose fauna is strictly homogeneous, that country is Australia; while New
  Guinea on the one hand, and New Zealand on the other, are as sharply differentiated from Australia
  as any adjacent parts of the same primary zoological division can possibly be. Yet the "<i>law of
  circumpolar distribution</i>" leads to the division of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page68">{68}</span>Australia by an arbitrary east and west line, and a union of the northern
  two-thirds with New Guinea, the southern third with New Zealand. Hardly less unnatural is the
  supposed equivalence of South Africa (the African temperate realm) to all tropical Africa and
  Asia, including Madagascar (the Indo-African tropical realm). South Africa has, it is true, some
  striking peculiarities; but they are absolutely unimportant as compared with the great and radical
  differences between tropical Africa and tropical Asia. On these examples we may fairly rest our
  rejection of Mr. Allen's scheme.</p>

  <p>We must however say a few words on the zoo-geographical nomenclature proposed in the same
  paper, which seems also very objectionable. The following terms are proposed: <i>realm</i>,
  <i>region</i>, <i>province</i>, <i>district</i>, <i>fauna and flora</i>; the first being the
  highest, the last the lowest and smallest sub-division. Considering that most of these terms have
  been used in very different senses already, and that no means of settling their equivalence in
  different parts of the globe has been even suggested, such a complex system must lead to endless
  confusion. Until the whole subject is far better known and its first principles agreed upon, the
  simpler and the fewer the terms employed the better; and as "region" was employed for the primary
  divisions by Mr. Sclater, eighteen years ago, and again by Mr. Andrew Murray, in his Geographical
  Distribution of Mammals; nothing but obscurity can result from each writer using some new, and
  doubtfully better, term. For the sub-divisions of the regions no advantage is gained by the use of
  a distinct term&mdash;"province"&mdash;which has been used (by Swainson) for the primary
  divisions, and which does not itself tell you what rank it holds; whereas the term "sub-region"
  speaks for itself as being unmistakably next in subordination to region, and this clearness of
  meaning gives it the preference over any independent term. As to minor named sub-divisions, they
  seem at present uncalled for; and till the greater divisions are themselves generally agreed on,
  it seems better to adopt no technical names for what must, for a long time to come, be
  indeterminate.</p>

  <p><i>Does the Arctic Fauna characterize an independent <span class="pagenum"
  id="page69">{69}</span>Region.</i>&mdash;The proposal to consider the Arctic regions as
  constituting one of the primary zoological divisions of the globe, has been advocated by many
  naturalists. Professor Huxley seems to consider it advisable, and Mr. Allen unhesitatingly adopts
  it, as well as an "antarctic" region to balance it in the southern hemisphere. The reason why an
  "Arctic Region" finds no place in this work may therefore be here stated.</p>

  <p>No species or group of animals can properly be classed as "arctic," which does not exclusively
  inhabit or greatly preponderate in arctic lands. For the purpose of establishing the need of an
  "arctic" zoological region, we should consider chiefly such groups as are circumpolar as well as
  arctic; because, if they are confined to, or greatly preponderate in, either the eastern or
  western hemispheres, they can be at once allocated to the Nearctic or Palæarctic regions, and can
  therefore afford no justification for establishing a new primary division of the globe.</p>

  <p>Thus restricted, only three genera of land mammalia are truly arctic: <i>Gulo</i>,
  <i>Myodes</i>, and <i>Rangifer</i>. Two species of widely dispersed genera are also exclusively
  arctic, <i>Ursus maritimus</i> and <i>Vulpes lagopus</i>.</p>

  <p>Exclusively arctic birds are not much more numerous. Of land birds there are only three genera
  (each consisting of but a single species), <i>Pinicola</i>, <i>Nyctea</i>, and <i>Surnia</i>.
  <i>Lagopus</i> is circumpolar, but the genus has too wide an extension in the temperate zone to be
  considered arctic. Among aquatic birds we have the genus of ducks, <i>Somateria</i>; three genera
  of Uriidæ, <i>Uria</i>, <i>Catarractes</i>, and <i>Mergulus</i>; and the small family Alcidæ,
  consisting of the genera <i>Alca</i> and <i>Fratercula</i>. Our total then is, three genera of
  mammalia, three of land, and six of aquatic birds, including one peculiar family.</p>

  <p>In the southern hemisphere there is only the single genus <i>Aptenodytes</i> that can be
  classed as antarctic; and even that is more properly south temperate.</p>

  <p>In dealing with this arctic fauna we have two courses open to us; we must either group them
  with the other species and genera which are common to the two northern regions, or we <span
  class="pagenum" id="page70">{70}</span>must form a separate primary region for them. As a matter
  of convenience the former plan seems the best; and it is that which is in accordance with our
  treatment of other intermediate tracts which contain special forms of life. The great desert zone,
  extending from the Atlantic shores of the Sahara across Arabia to Central Asia, is a connecting
  link between the Palæarctic, Ethiopian, and Oriental regions, and contains a number of "desert"
  forms wholly or almost wholly restricted to it; but the attempt to define it as a separate region
  would introduce difficulty and confusion. Neither to the "desert" nor to the "arctic" regions
  could any defined limits, either geographical or zoological, be placed; and the attempt to
  determine what species or genera should be allotted to them would prove an insoluble problem. The
  reason perhaps is, that both are essentially unstable, to a much greater extent than those great
  masses of land with more or less defined barriers, which constitute our six regions. The Arctic
  Zone has been, within a recent geological period, both vastly more extensive and vastly less
  extensive than it is at present. At a not distant epoch it extended over half of Europe and of
  North America. At an earlier date it appears to have vanished altogether; since a luxuriant
  vegetation of tall deciduous trees and broad-leaved evergreens flourished within ten degrees of
  the Pole! The great deserts have not improbably been equally fluctuating; hence neither the one
  nor the other can present that marked individuality in their forms of life, which seems to have
  arisen only when extensive tracts of land have retained some considerable stability both of
  surface and climatal conditions, during periods sufficient for the development and co-adaptation
  of their several assemblages of plants and animals.</p>

  <p>We must also consider that there is no geographical difficulty in dividing the Arctic Zone
  between the two northern regions. The only debateable lands, Greenland and Iceland, are generally
  admitted to belong respectively to America and Europe. Neither is there any zoological difficulty;
  for the land mammalia and birds are on the whole wonderfully restricted to their respective
  regions even in high latitudes; and the aquatic forms <span class="pagenum"
  id="page71">{71}</span>are, for our present purpose, of much less importance. As a primary
  division the "Arctic region" would be out of all proportion to the other six, whether as regards
  its few peculiar types or the limited number of forms and species actually inhabiting it; but it
  comes in well as a connecting link between two regions, where the peculiar forms of both are
  specially modified; and is in this respect quite analogous to the great desert zone above referred
  to.</p>

  <p>I now proceed to characterize briefly the six regions adopted in the present work, together
  with the sub-regions into which they may be most conveniently and naturally divided, as shown in
  our general map.</p>

  <p><i>Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;This very extensive region comprises all temperate Europe and
  Asia, from Iceland to Behring's Straits and from the Azores to Japan. Its southern boundary is
  somewhat indefinite, but it seems advisable to comprise in it all the extra-tropical part of the
  Sahara and Arabia, and all Persia, Cabul, and Beloochistan to the Indus. It comes down to a little
  below the upper limit of forests in the Himalayas, and includes the larger northern half of China,
  not quite so far down the coast as Amoy. It has been said that this region differs from the
  Oriental by negative characters only; a host of tropical families and genera being absent, while
  there is little or nothing but peculiar species to characterize it absolutely. This however is not
  true. The Palæarctic region is well characterized by possessing 3 families of vertebrata peculiar
  to it, as well as 35 peculiar genera of mammalia, and 57 of birds, constituting about one-third of
  the total number it possesses. These are amply sufficient to characterize a region positively; but
  we must also consider the absence of many important groups of the Oriental, Ethiopian, and
  Nearctic regions; and we shall then find, that taking positive and negative characters together,
  and making some allowance for the necessary poverty of a temperate as compared with tropical
  regions, the Palæarctic is almost as strongly marked and well defined as any other.</p>

  <p><i>Sub-divisions of the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;These are by no means <span
  class="pagenum" id="page72">{72}</span>so clearly indicated as in some of the other regions, and
  they are adopted more for convenience than because they are very natural or strongly marked.</p>

  <p>The first, or European sub-region, comprises Central and Northern Europe as far South as the
  Pyrenees, the Maritime and Dinaric Alps, the Balkan mountains, the Black Sea, and the Caucasus. On
  the east the Caspian sea and the Ural mountains seem the most obvious limit; but it is doubtful if
  they form the actual boundary, which is perhaps better marked by the valley of the Irtish, where a
  pre-glacial sea almost certainly connected the Aral and Caspian seas with the Arctic ocean, and
  formed an effective barrier which must still, to some extent, influence the distribution of
  animals.</p>

  <p>The next, or Mediterranean sub-region, comprises South Europe, North Africa with the
  extra-tropical portion of the Sahara, and Egypt to about the first or second cataracts; and
  eastward through Asia Minor, Persia, and Cabul, to the deserts of the Indus.</p>

  <p>The third, or Siberian sub-region, consists of all north and central Asia north of Herat, as
  far as the eastern limits of the great desert plateau of Mongolia, and southward to about the
  upper limit of trees on the Himalayas.</p>

  <p>The fourth, or Manchurian sub-region, consists of Japan and North China with the lower valley
  of the Amoor; and it should probably be extended westward in a narrow strip along the Himalayas,
  embracing about 1,000 or 2,000 feet of vertical distance below the upper limit of trees, till it
  meets an eastern extension of the Mediterranean sub-region a little beyond Simla. These extensions
  are necessary to avoid passing from the Oriental region, which is essentially tropical, directly
  to the Siberian sub-region, which has an extreme northern character; whereas the Mediterranean and
  Manchurian sub-regions are more temperate in climate. It will be found that between the upper
  limit of most of the typical Oriental groups and the Thibetan or Siberian fauna, there is a zone
  in which many forms occur common to temperate China. This is especially the case among the
  pheasants and finches.</p>

  <p><i>Ethiopian Region.</i>&mdash;The limits of this region have been indicated by the definition
  of the Palæarctic region. Besides Africa south of the tropic of Cancer, and its islands, it
  comprises the southern half of Arabia.</p>

  <p>This region has been said to be identical in the main characters of its mammalian fauna with
  the Oriental region, and has therefore been united with it by Mr. A. Murray. Most important
  differences have however been overlooked, as the following summary of the peculiarities of the
  Ethiopian region will, I think, show.</p>

  <p>It possesses 22 peculiar families of vertebrates; 90 peculiar genera of mammalia, being
  two-thirds of its whole number; and 179 peculiar genera of birds, being three-fifths of all it
  possesses. It is further characterized by the absence of several families and genera which range
  over the whole northern hemisphere, details of which will be found in the chapter treating of the
  region. There are, it is true, many points of resemblance, not to be wondered at between two
  tropical regions in the same hemisphere, and which have evidently been at one time more nearly
  connected, both by intervening lands and by a different condition of the lands that even now
  connect them. But these resemblances only render the differences more remarkable; since they show
  that there has been an ancient and long-continued separation of the two regions, developing a
  distinct fauna in each, and establishing marked specialities which the temporary
  intercommunication and immigration has not sufficed to remove. The entire absence of such
  wide-spread groups as bears and deer, from a country many parts of which are well adapted to them,
  and in close proximity to regions where they abound, would alone mark out the Ethiopian region as
  one of the primary divisions of the earth, even if it possessed a less number than it actually
  does of peculiar family and generic groups.</p>

  <p><i>Sub-divisions of the Ethiopian Region.</i>&mdash;The African continent south of the tropic
  of Cancer is more homogeneous in its prominent and superficial zoological features than most of
  the other regions, but there are nevertheless important and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page74">{74}</span>deep-seated local peculiarities. Two portions can be marked off as
  possessing many peculiar forms; the luxuriant forest district of equatorial West Africa, and the
  southern extremity or Cape district. The remaining portion has no well-marked divisions, and a
  large proportion of its animal forms range over it from Nubia and Abyssinia, to Senegal on the one
  side and to the Zambesi on the other; this forms our first or East-African sub-region.</p>

  <p>The second, or West African sub-region extends along the coast from Senegal to Angola, and
  inland to the sources of the Shary and the Congo.</p>

  <p>The third, or South African sub-region, comprises the Cape Colony and Natal, and is roughly
  limited by a line from Delagoa Bay to Walvish Bay.</p>

  <p>The fourth, or Malagasy sub-region, consists of Madagascar and the adjacent islands, from
  Rodriguez to the Seychelles; and this differs so remarkably from the continent that it has been
  proposed to form a distinct primary region for its reception. Its productions are indeed highly
  interesting; since it possesses 3 families, and 2 sub-families of mammals peculiar to itself,
  while almost all its genera are peculiar. Of these a few show Oriental or Ethiopian affinities,
  but the remainder are quite isolated. Turning to other classes of animals, we find that the birds
  are almost as remarkable; but, as might be expected, a larger number of genera are common to
  surrounding countries. More than 30 genera are altogether peculiar, and some of these are so
  isolated as to require to be classed in separate families or sub-families. The African affinity is
  however here more strongly shown by the considerable number (13) of peculiar Ethiopian genera
  which in Madagascar have representative species. There can be no doubt therefore about Madagascar
  being more nearly related to the Ethiopian than to any other region; but its peculiarities are so
  great, that, were it not for its small size and the limited extent of its fauna, its claim to rank
  as a separate region might not seem unreasonable. It is true that it is not poorer in mammals than
  Australia; but that country is far more isolated, and cannot be so decidedly and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page75">{75}</span>naturally associated with any other region as Madagascar
  can be with the Ethiopian. It is therefore the better and more natural course to keep it as a
  sub-region; the peculiarities it exhibits being of exactly the same kind as those presented by the
  Antilles, by New Zealand, and even by Celebes and Ceylon, but in a much greater degree.</p>

  <p><i>Oriental Region.</i>&mdash;On account of the numerous objections that have been made to
  naming a region from the least characteristic portion of it, and not thinking "Malayan," proposed
  by Mr. Blanford, a good term, (as it has a very circumscribed and definite meaning, and especially
  because the "Malay" archipelago is half of it in the Australian region,) I propose to use the word
  "Oriental" instead of "Indian," as being geographically applicable to the whole of the countries
  included in the region and to very few beyond it; as being euphonious, and as being free from all
  confusion with terms already used in zoological geography. I trust therefore that it may meet with
  general acceptance.</p>

  <p>This small, compact, but rich and varied region, consists of all India and China from the
  limits of the Palæarctic region; all the Malay peninsula and islands as far east as Java and Baly,
  Borneo and the Philippine Islands; and Formosa. It is positively characterized by possessing 12
  peculiar families of vertebrata; by 55 genera of land mammalia, and 165 genera of land birds,
  altogether confined to it; these peculiar genera forming in each case about one half of the total
  number it possesses.</p>

  <p><i>Sub-divisions of the Oriental region.</i>&mdash;First we have the Indian sub-region,
  consisting of Central India from the foot of the Himalayas in the west, and south of the Ganges to
  the east, as far as a line drawn from Goa curving south and up to the Kistna river; this is the
  portion which has most affinity with Africa.</p>

  <p>The second, or Ceylonese sub-region, consists of the southern extremity of India with Ceylon;
  this is a mountainous forest region, and possesses several peculiar forms as well as some Malayan
  types not found in the first sub-region.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page76">{76}</span></div>

  <p>Next we have the Indo-Chinese sub-region, comprising South China and Burmah, extending westward
  along the Himalayan range to an altitude of about 9,000 or 10,000 feet, and southward to Tavoy or
  Tenasserim.</p>

  <p>The last is the Indo-Malayan sub-region, comprising the Peninsula of Malacca and the Malay
  Islands to Baly, Borneo, and the Philippines.</p>

  <p>On account of the absence from the first sub-region of many of the forms most characteristic of
  the other three, and the number of families and genera of mammalia and birds which occur in it and
  also in Africa, it has been thought by some naturalists that this part of India has at least an
  equal claim to be classed as a part of the Ethiopian region. This question will be found fully
  discussed in Chapter XII. devoted to the Oriental region, where it is shown that the African
  affinity is far less than has been represented, and that in all its essential features Central
  India is wholly Oriental in its fauna.</p>

  <p>Before leaving this region a few words may be said about Lemuria, a name proposed by Mr.
  Sclater for the site of a supposed submerged continent extending from Madagascar to Ceylon and
  Sumatra, in which the Lemuroid type of animals was developed. This is undoubtedly a legitimate and
  highly probable supposition, and it is an example of the way in which a study of the geographical
  distribution of animals may enable us to reconstruct the geography of a bygone age. But we must
  not, as Mr. Blyth proposed, make this hypothetical land one of our actual Zoological regions. It
  represents what was probably a primary Zoological region in some past geological epoch; but what
  that epoch was and what were the limits of the region in question, we are quite unable to say. If
  we are to suppose that it comprised the whole area now inhabited by Lemuroid animals, we must make
  it extend from West Africa to Burmah, South China, and Celebes; an area which it possibly did once
  occupy, but which cannot be formed into a modern Zoological region without violating much more
  important affinities. If, on the other hand, we leave out all those areas which undoubtedly belong
  to other regions, we reduce Lemuria to Madagascar and its adjacent <span class="pagenum"
  id="page77">{77}</span>islands, which, for reasons already stated, it is not advisable to treat as
  a primary Zoological region. The theory of this ancient continent and the light it may throw on
  existing anomalies of distribution, will be more fully considered in the geographical part of this
  work.</p>

  <p><i>Australian Region.</i>&mdash;Mr. Sclater's original name seems preferable to Professor
  Huxley's, "Austral-Asian;" the inconvenience of which alteration is sufficiently shown by the fact
  that Mr. Blyth proposed to use the very same term as an appropriate substitute for the "Indian
  region" of Mr. Sclater. Australia is the great central mass of the region; it is by far the
  richest in varied and highly remarkable forms of life; and it therefore seems in every way fitted
  to give a name to the region of which it is the essential element. The limits of this region in
  the Pacific are somewhat obscure, but as so many of the Pacific Islands are extremely poor
  zoologically, this is not of great importance.</p>

  <p><i>Sub-divisions of the Australian Region.</i>&mdash;The first sub-region is the
  Austro-Malayan, including the islands from Celebes and Lombock on the west to the Solomon Islands
  on the east. The Australian sub-region comes next, consisting of Australia and Tasmania. The
  third, or Polynesian sub-region, will consist of all the tropical Pacific Islands, and is
  characterized by several peculiar genera of birds which are all allied to Australian types. The
  fourth, consists of New Zealand with Auckland, Chatham, and Norfolk Islands, and must be called
  the New Zealand sub-region.</p>

  <p>The extreme peculiarities of New Zealand, due no doubt to its great isolation and to its being
  the remains of a more extensive land, have induced several naturalists to suggest that it ought
  justly to form a Zoological region by itself. But the inconveniences of such a procedure have been
  already pointed out; and when we look at its birds as a whole (they being the only class
  sufficiently well represented to found any conclusion upon) we find that the majority of them
  belong to Australian genera, and where the genera are peculiar they are most nearly related to
  Australian types. The preservation in these islands <span class="pagenum"
  id="page78">{78}</span>of a single representative of a unique order of reptiles, is, as before
  remarked, of the same character as the preservation of the <i>Proteus</i> in the caverns of
  Carniola; and can give the locality where it happens to have survived no claim to form a primary
  Zoological region, unless supported by a tolerably varied and distinctly characterized fauna, such
  as never exists in a very restricted and insular area.</p>

  <p><i>Neotropical Region.</i>&mdash;Mr. Sclater's original name for this region is preserved,
  because change of nomenclature is always an evil; and neither Professor Huxley's suggested
  alteration "Austro-Columbia," nor Mr. Sclater's new term "Dendrogæa," appear to be improvements.
  The region is essentially a tropical one, and the extra-tropical portion of it is not important
  enough to make the name inappropriate. That proposed by Professor Huxley is not free from the same
  kind of criticism, since it would imply that the region was exclusively South American, whereas a
  considerable tract of North America belongs to it. This region includes South America, the
  Antilles and tropical North America; and it possesses more peculiar families of vertebrates and
  genera of birds and mammalia than any other region.</p>

  <p><i>Subdivisions of the Neotropical Region.</i>&mdash;The great central mass of South America,
  from the shores of Venezuela to Paraguay and Eastern Peru, constitutes the chief division, and may
  be termed the Brazilian sub-region. It is on the whole a forest country; its most remarkable forms
  are highly developed arboreal types; and it exhibits all the characteristics of this rich and
  varied continent in their highest development.</p>

  <p>The second, or Chilian sub-region, consists of the open plains, pampas, and mountains of the
  southern extremity of the continent; and we must include in it the west side of the Andes as far
  as the limits of the forest near Payta, and the whole of the high Andean plateaus as far as 4° of
  south latitude; which makes it coincide with the range of the Camelidæ and Chinchillidæ.</p>

  <p>The third, or Mexican sub-region, consists of Central America and Southern Mexico, but it has
  no distinguishing <span class="pagenum" id="page79">{79}</span>characteristics except the absence
  of some of the more highly specialized Neotropical groups. It is, however, a convenient division
  as comprising the portion of the North American continent which belongs zoologically to South
  America.</p>

  <p>The fourth, or Antillean sub-region, consists of the West India islands (except Trinidad and
  Tobago, which are detached portions of the continent and must be grouped in the first sub-region);
  and these reproduce, in a much less marked degree, the phenomena presented by Madagascar.
  Terrestrial mammals are almost entirely wanting, but the larger islands possess three genera which
  are altogether peculiar to them. The birds are of South American forms, but comprise many peculiar
  genera. Terrestrial molluscs are more abundant and varied than in any part of the globe of equal
  extent; and if these alone were considered, the Antilles would constitute an important Zoological
  region.</p>

  <p><i>Nearctic Region.</i>&mdash;This region comprises all temperate North America and Greenland.
  The arctic lands and islands beyond the limit of trees form a transitional territory to the
  Palæarctic region, but even here there are some characteristic species. The southern limit between
  this region and the Neotropical is a little uncertain; but it may be drawn at about the Rio Grande
  del Norte on the east coast, and a little north of Mazatlan on the west; while on the central
  plateau it descends much farther south, and should perhaps include all the open highlands of
  Mexico and Guatemala. This would coincide with the range of several characteristic Nearctic
  genera.</p>

  <p><i>Distinction of the Nearctic from the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;The Nearctic region
  possesses twelve peculiar families of vertebrates or one-tenth of its whole number. It has also
  twenty-four peculiar genera of mammalia and fifty-two of birds, in each case nearly one-third of
  all it possesses. This proportion is very nearly the same as in the Palæarctic region, while the
  number of peculiar families of vertebrata is very much greater. It has been already seen that both
  Mr. Blyth and Professor Huxley are disposed to unite this region with the Palæarctic, while
  Professor Newton, in his article on birds in the new edition of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page80">{80}</span>Encyclopædia Britannica, thinks that as regards that class it can hardly
  claim to be more than a sub-region of the Neotropical. These views are mutually destructive, but
  it will be shown in the proper place, that on independent grounds the Nearctic region can very
  properly be maintained.</p>

  <p><i>Subdivisions of the Nearctic Region.</i>&mdash;The sub-regions here depend on the great
  physical features of the country, and have been in some cases accurately defined by American
  naturalists. First we have the Californian sub-region, consisting of California and Oregon&mdash;a
  narrow tract between the Sierra Nevada and the Pacific, but characterized by a number of peculiar
  species and by several genera found nowhere else in the region.</p>

  <p>The second, or Rocky Mountain sub-region, consists of this great mountain range with its
  plateaus, and the central plains and prairies to about 100° west longitude, but including New
  Mexico and Texas in the South.</p>

  <p>The third and most important sub-region, which may be termed the Alleghanian, extends eastward
  to the Atlantic, including the Mississippi Valley, the Alleghany Mountains, and the Eastern United
  States. This is an old forest district, and contains most of the characteristic animal types of
  the region.</p>

  <p>The fourth, or Canadian sub-region, comprises all the northern part of the continent from the
  great lakes to the Arctic ocean; a land of pine-forests and barren wastes, characterized by Arctic
  types and the absence of many of the genera which distinguish the more southern portions of the
  region.</p>

  <p><i>Observations on the series of Sub-regions.</i>&mdash;The twenty-four sub-regions here
  adopted were arrived at by a careful consideration of the distribution of the more important
  genera, and of the materials, both zoological and geographical, available for their determination;
  and it was not till they were almost finally decided on, that they were found to be equal in
  number throughout all the regions&mdash;four in each. As this uniformity is of great advantage in
  tabular and diagrammatic presentations of the distribution of the several families, I decided not
  to disturb it unless very strong reasons should appear for adopting a greater or less number in
  any particular case. Such however have not <span class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span>arisen;
  and it is hoped that these divisions will prove as satisfactory and useful to naturalists in
  general as they have been to the author. Of course, in a detailed study of any region much more
  minute sub-division may be required; but even in that case it is believed that the sub-regions
  here adopted, will be found, with slight modifications, permanently available for exhibiting
  general results.</p>

  <p>I give here a table showing the proportionate richness and speciality of each region as
  determined by its <i>families</i> of vertebrates and <i>genera</i> of mammalia and birds; and also
  a general table of the regions and sub-regions, arranged in the order that seems best to show
  their mutual relations.</p>

  <p>A little consideration will convince us, that no inquiry into the causes and laws which
  determine the geographical distribution of animals or plants can lead to satisfactory results,
  unless we have a tolerably accurate knowledge of the affinities of the several species, genera,
  and families to each other; in other words, we require a natural classification to work upon. Let
  us, for example, take three animals&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>&mdash;which have a
  general external resemblance to each other, and are usually considered to be really allied; and
  let us suppose that <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> inhabit the same or adjacent districts, while c is found
  far away on the other side of the globe, with no animals at all resembling it in any of the
  intervening countries. We should here have a difficult problem to solve; for we should have to
  show that the general laws by which we account for the main features of distribution, will explain
  this exceptional case. But now, suppose some comparative anatomist takes these animals in hand,
  and finds that the resemblance of <i>c</i> to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is only superficial, while
  their internal structure exhibits marked and important differences; and that <i>c</i> really
  belongs to another group of animals, <i>d</i>, which inhabits the very region in which <i>c</i>
  was found&mdash;and we should no longer have anything to explain. This is no imaginary case. Up to
  a very few years ago a curious Mexican animal, <i>Bassaris astuta</i>, was almost always classed
  in the civet family (Viverridæ), a group entirely <span class="pagenum"
  id="page84">{84}</span>confined to Africa and Asia; but it has now been conclusively shown by
  Professor Flower that its real affinities are with the racoons (Procyonidæ), a group confined to
  North and South America. In another case, however, an equally careful examination shows, that an
  animal peculiar to the Himalayas (<i>Ælurus fulgens</i>) has its nearest ally in the
  <i>Cercoleptes</i> of South America. Here, therefore, the geographical difficulty really exists,
  and any satisfactory theory of the causes that have led to the existing distribution of living
  things, must be able to account, more or less definitely, for this and other anomalies. From these
  cases it will be evident, that if any class or order of animals is very imperfectly known and its
  classification altogether artificial, it is useless to attempt to account for the anomalies its
  distribution may present; since those anomalies may be, to a great extent, due to false notions as
  to the affinities of its component species.</p>

  <p>According to the laws and causes of distribution discussed in the preceding chapters, we should
  find limited and defined distribution to be the rule, universal or indefinite distribution to be
  the exception, in every natural group corresponding to what are usually regarded as families and
  genera; and so much is this the case in nature, that when we find a group of this nominal rank
  scattered as it were at random over the earth, we have a strong presumption that it is not
  natural; but is, to a considerable extent, a haphazard collection of species. Of course this
  reasoning will only apply, in cases where there are no unusual means of dispersal, nor any
  exceptional causes which might determine a scattered distribution.</p>

  <p>From the considerations now adduced it becomes evident, that it is of the first importance for
  the success of our inquiry to secure a natural classification of animals, especially as regards
  the families and genera. The higher groups, such as classes and orders, are of less importance for
  our purpose; because they are almost always widely and often universally distributed, except those
  which are so small as to be evidently the nearly extinct representatives of a once more extensive
  series of forms. We now proceed to explain the classification to be adopted, as low down as the
  series of families. To these, equivalent English <span class="pagenum"
  id="page85">{85}</span>names are given wherever they exist, in order that readers possessing no
  technical knowledge, may form some conception of the meaning of the term "family" in zoology.</p>

  <p>The above series of orders is arranged according to Professor Flower's <i>Osteology of
  Mammalia</i>, and they will follow in this succession throughout my work. Professor Huxley
  arranges the same orders in a different series.</p>

  <p>In determining the manner in which the several orders shall be subdivided into families, I have
  been guided in my choice of classifications mainly by the degree of attention the author appears
  to have paid to the group, and his known ability as a systematic zoologist; and in a less degree
  by considerations of convenience as regards the special purposes of geographical distribution. In
  many cases it is a matter of great doubt whether a certain group should form several distinct
  families or be united into one or two; but one method may bring out the peculiarities of
  distribution much better than the other, and this is, in our case, a sufficient reason for
  adopting it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For the Primates I follow, with some modifications, the classification of Mr. St.
  George Mivart given in his article "Apes" in the new edition of the <i>Encyclopædia

  <p class="sp4">The Cetacea is one of those orders the classification of which is very unsettled.
  The animals comprising it are so huge, and there is so much difficulty in preserving them, that
  only a very few species are known with anything like completeness. A considerable number of genera
  and species have been described or indicated; but as many of these are founded on imperfect
  specimens of perhaps a single individual, it is not to be wondered at that those few naturalists
  who occupy themselves with the study of these large animals, cannot agree as to the proper mode of
  grouping them into natural families. They are, however, of but little importance to us, as almost
  all the species inhabit the ocean, and of only a few of them can it be said that anything is
  accurately known of their distribution. I therefore consider it best to follow Professor Carus,
  who makes a smaller number of families; but I give also the arrangement of Dr. Gray in his British
  Museum catalogue of whales and seals, as modified subsequently in the <i>Proceedings of Zoological
  Society</i>, 1870, p. 772. The Zeuglodontidæ, a family of extinct tertiary whales, are classed by
  Professors Owen and Carus between Cetacea and Sirenia, while Professor Huxley considers them to
  have been carnivorous and allied to the seals.</p>

  than follow his arrangement with unimportant modifications. Professor Lilljeborg, of Upsala, has
  however made a special study of this group of animals, and has given an original and detailed
  classification of all the genera. (<i>Systematisk Öfversigt af de Gnagande Däggdjuren, Glires.

  <p class="ac">BIRDS.</p>

  <p>Birds are perhaps the most difficult to classify of all the divisions of the vertebrata. The
  species and genera are exceedingly numerous, and there is such a great uniformity in general
  structure and even in the details of external form, that it is exceedingly difficult to find
  characters by which orders and families can be characterised. For a long time the system of Vigors
  and Swainson was followed; but this wholly ignored anatomical characters and in many cases plainly
  violated well-marked affinities. Characters derived from the form of the sternum, the scutellation
  of the tarsi, and the arrangement of the feathers, have all assisted in determining natural
  groups. More recently Professor Huxley has applied the variations of the bony palate to the
  general arrangement of birds; and still more recently Professor Garrod has studied certain
  leg-muscles for the same purpose. The condition of the young as regards plumage, and even the
  form, texture, and coloration of the egg, have also been applied to solve doubtful cases of
  affinity; yet the problem is not settled, and it will probably remain for another generation of
  ornithologists to determine with any approach to accuracy what are the most natural divisions of
  the class into orders and families. In a work like the present it is evidently not advisable to
  adopt all the recent classifications; since experience has shown that no arrangement in which one
  set of characters is mainly relied on, long holds its ground. Such modifications of the old system
  as seem to be well established will be adopted; but the older groups will be adhered to in cases
  where the most recent classifications are open to doubt, or seem inconvenient as separating
  families, which, owing to their similarity in general structure, form and habits are best kept
  together for the purposes of geographical distribution.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The old plan of putting the birds of prey at the head of the class, is now almost
  wholly given up; both because they are not <span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span>the most
  highly organised, but only one of the most specialised forms of birds, and because their
  affinities are not with the Passeres, but rather with the cormorants and some other of the aquatic
  groups. The Passeres therefore are placed first; and the series of families is begun by the
  thrushes, which are certainly the most typical and generally well-organised form of birds. Instead
  of the Scansores and Fissirostres of the older authors, the order Picariæ, which includes them
  both, is adopted, but with some reluctance; as the former are, generally speaking, well marked and
  strongly contrasted groups, although certain families have been shown to be intermediate. In the
  Picariæ are included the goat-suckers, swifts, and humming-birds, sometimes separated as a
  distinct order, Macrochires. The parrots and the pigeons form each a separate order. The old
  groups of Grallæ and Anseres are preserved, as more convenient than breaking them up into widely
  separated parts; for though the latter plan may in some cases more strictly represent their
  affinities, its details are not yet established, nor is it much used by ornithologists. In
  accordance with these views the following is the series of orders and families of birds adopted in
  this work:</p>

  <p>The preceding arrangement is a modification of that proposed by myself in the <i>Ibis</i>
  (1874, p. 406). The principal alterations are adding the families Panuridæ and Sittidæ in series
  A, commencing series B with Dicæidæ; bringing Vireonidæ next to the allied American family
  Mniotiltidæ; and placing Motacillidæ in series C next to Alaudidæ. At the suggestion of Professor
  Newton I place Menuridæ and Atrichidæ apart from the other Passeres, as they both possess striking
  peculiarities of anatomical structure.</p>

  unite three of his sub-classes; but as his catalogue will long remain a handbook for every student

  bracketing together the groups he now thinks should be united.</p>

  <p>The families and genera of insects are so immensely numerous, probably exceeding fifty-fold
  those of all other land animals, that for this cause alone it would be impossible to enter fully
  into their distribution. It is also quite unnecessary, because many of the groups are so liable to
  be transported by accidental causes, that they afford no useful information for our subject; while
  others are so obscure and uninteresting that they have been very partially collected and studied,
  and are for this reason equally ineligible. I have therefore selected a few of the largest and
  most conspicuous families, which have been so assiduously collected in every part of the globe,
  and so carefully studied at home, as to afford valuable materials for comparison with the
  vertebrate groups, when we have made due allowance for the dependence of many insects on peculiar
  forms of vegetation, and the facility with which many of them are transported either in the egg,
  larva, or perfect state, by winds, currents, and other less known means.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I confine myself then, almost exclusively, to the sixteen families of Diurnal
  Lepidoptera or butterflies, and to six of the most extensive, conspicuous, and popular families of
  Coleoptera. <span class="pagenum" id="page103">{103}</span>The number of species of Butterflies is
  about the same as that of Birds, while the six families of Coleoptera selected, comprise more than
  twenty thousand species, far exceeding the number of all other vertebrates. These families have
  all been recently catalogued, so that we have very complete information as to their arrangement
  and distribution.</p>

  <p>Although it may seem somewhat out of place to begin the systematic treatment of our subject
  with extinct rather than with living animals, it is necessary to do so in order that we may see
  the meaning and trace the causes of the existing distribution of animal forms. It is true, that
  the animals found fossil in a country are very generally allied to those which still inhabit it;
  but this is by no means universally the case. If it were, the attempt to elucidate our subject by
  Palæontology would be hopeless, since the past would show us the same puzzling diversities of
  faunas and floras that now exist. We find however very numerous exceptions to this rule, and it is
  these exceptions which tell us of the past migrations of whole groups of animals. We are thus
  enabled to determine what portion of the existing races of animals in a country are descendants of
  its ancient fauna, and which are comparatively modern immigrants; and combining these movements of
  the forms of life with known or probable changes in the distribution of land and sea, we shall
  sometimes be able to trace approximately the long series of changes which have resulted in the
  actual state of things. To gain this knowledge is our object in studying the "Geographical
  Distribution of Animals," and our plan of study must be determined, mainly, by the facilities it
  affords us for attaining this object. In discussing the countless details of distribution we shall
  meet with in our survey of the zoological regions, we shall often find it useful to refer to the
  evidence we possess of the range of the group in question in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page108">{108}</span>past times; and when we attempt to generalise the phenomena on a large
  scale, with the details fresh in our memory, we shall find a reference to the extinct faunas of
  various epochs to be absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>The degree of our knowledge of the Palæontology of various parts of the world is so unequal,
  that it will not be advisable to treat the subject under each of our six regions. Yet some
  subdivision must be made, and it seems best to consider separately the extinct animals of the Old
  and of the New Worlds. Those of Europe and Asia are intimately connected, and throw light on the
  past changes which have led to the establishment of the three great continental Old World regions,
  with their various subdivisions. The wonderful extinct fauna recently discovered in North America,
  with what was previously known from South temperate America, not only elucidates the past history
  of the whole continent, but also gives indications of the mutual relations of the eastern and
  western hemispheres.</p>

  <p>The materials to be dealt with are enormous; and it will be necessary to confine ourselves to a
  general summary, with fuller details on those points which directly bear upon our special subject.
  The objects of most interest to the pure zoologist and to the geologist&mdash;those strange forms
  which are farthest removed from any now living&mdash;are of least interest to us, since we aim at
  tracing the local origin or birthplace of existing genera and families; and for this purpose
  animals whose affinities with living forms are altogether doubtful, are of no value whatever.</p>

  <p>The great mass of the vertebrate fossils of the tertiary period consist of mammalia, and this
  is precisely the class which is of most value in the determination of zoological regions. The
  animals of the secondary period, though of the highest interest to the zoologist are of little
  importance to us; both because of their very uncertain affinities for any existing groups, and
  also because we can form no adequate notion of the distribution of land and sea in those remote
  epochs. Our great object is to trace back, step by step, the varying distribution of the chief
  forms of life; and to deduce, wherever possible, the physical changes which must have accompanied
  or caused such changes. <span class="pagenum" id="page109">{109}</span>The natural division of our
  subject therefore is into geological periods. We first go back to the Post-Pliocene period, which
  includes that of the caves and gravels of Europe containing flint implements, and extends back to
  the deposit of the glacial drift in the concluding phase of the glacial epoch. Next we have the
  Pliocene period, divided into its later portion (the Newer Pliocene) which includes the Glacial
  epoch of the northern hemisphere; and its earlier portion (the Older Pliocene), represented by the
  red and coralline crag of England, and deposits of similar age in the continent. During this
  earlier epoch the climate was not very dissimilar from that which now prevails; but we next get
  evidence of a still earlier period, the Miocene, when a warmer climate prevailed in Europe, and
  the whole fauna and flora were very different. This is perhaps the most interesting portion of the
  tertiary deposits, and furnishes us with the most valuable materials for our present study.
  Further back still we have the Eocene period, with apparently an almost tropical climate in
  Europe; and here we find a clue to some of the most puzzling facts in the distribution of living
  animals. Our knowledge of this epoch is however very imperfect; and we wait for discoveries that
  will elucidate some of the mystery that still hangs over the origin and migrations of many
  important families. Beyond this there is a great chasm in the geological record as regards land
  animals; and we have to go so far back into the past, that when we again meet with mammalia,
  birds, and land-reptiles, they appear under such archaic forms that they cease to have any local
  or geographical significance, and we can only refer them to wide-spread classes and orders. For
  the purpose of elucidating geographical distribution, therefore, it is, in the present state of
  our knowledge, unnecessary to go back beyond the tertiary period of geology.</p>

  <p>The remains of Mammalia being so much more numerous and important than those of other classes,
  we shall at first confine ourselves almost exclusively to these. What is known of the birds,
  reptiles, and fishes of the tertiary epoch will be best indicated by a brief connected sketch of
  their fossils in all parts of the globe, which we shall give in a subsequent chapter.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span></div>

  <p><i>Historic Period.</i>&mdash;In tracing back the history of the organic world we find, even
  within the limits of the historical period, that some animals have become extinct, while the
  distribution of others has been materially changed. The <i>Rytina</i> of the North Pacific, the
  dodo of Mauritius, and the great auk of the North Atlantic coasts, have been exterminated almost
  in our own times. The kitchen-middens of Denmark contain remains of the capercailzie, the <i>Bos
  primigenius</i>, and the beaver. The first still abounds farther north, the second is extinct, and
  the third is becoming so in Europe. The great Irish elk, a huge-antlered deer, probably existed
  almost down to historic times.</p>

  <p><i>Pleistocene or Post-Pliocene Period.</i>&mdash;We first meet with proofs of important
  changes in the character of the European fauna, in studying the remains found in the caverns of
  England and France, which have recently been so well explored. These cave-remains are probably all
  subsequent to the Glacial epoch, and they all come within the period of man's occupation of the
  country. Yet we find clear proofs of two distinct kinds of change in the forms of animal life.
  First we have a change clearly traceable to a difference of climate. We find such arctic forms as
  the rein-deer, the musk-sheep, the glutton, and the lemming, with the mammoth and the woolly
  rhinoceros of the Siberian ice-cliffs, inhabiting this country and even the south of France. This
  is held to be good proof that a sub-arctic climate prevailed over all Central Europe; and this
  climate, together with the continental condition of Britain, will sufficiently explain such a
  southward range of what are now arctic forms.</p>

  <p>But together with this change we have another that seems at first sight to be in an exactly
  opposite direction. We meet with numerous animals which now only inhabit Africa, or South Europe,
  or the warmer parts of Asia. Such are, large felines&mdash;some closely related to the lion
  (<i>Felis spelæa</i>), others of altogether extinct type (<i>Machairodus</i>) and forming the
  extreme development of the feline race;&mdash;hyænas; horses of two or more species; and a
  hippopotamus. If we go a little further back, to the remains furnished by the gravels and
  brick-earths, we still find the same association of forms. The reindeer, the glutton, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page111">{111}</span>the musk-sheep, and the woolly rhinoceros, are associated
  with several other species of rhinoceros and elephant; with numerous civets, now abundant only in
  warm countries; and with antelopes of several species. We also meet here with a great extension of
  range of forms now limited to small areas. The Saiga antelope of Eastern Europe occurs in France,
  where wild sheep and goats and the chamois were then found, together with several species of deer,
  of bear, and of hyæna. A few extinct genera even come down to this late period, such as the great
  sabre-toothed tiger, <i>Machairodus</i>; <i>Galeotherium</i>, a form of Viverridæ;
  <i>Palæospalax</i>, allied to the mole; and <i>Trogontherium</i>, a gigantic form of beaver,</p>

  <p>We find then, that even at so early a stage of our inquiries we meet with a problem in
  distribution by no means easy to solve. How are we to explain the banishment from Europe in so
  short a space of time (geologically speaking) of so many forms of life now characteristic of
  warmer countries, and this too during a period when the climate of Central Europe was itself
  becoming warmer? Such a change must almost certainly have been due to changes of physical
  geography, which we shall be better able to understand when we have examined the preceding
  Pliocene period. We may here notice, however, that so far as we yet know, this great recent change
  in the character of the fauna is confined to the western part of the Palæarctic region. In caves
  in the Altai Mountains examined by Prof. Brandt, a great collection of fossil bones was
  discovered. These comprised the Siberian rhinoceros and mammoth, and the cave hyæna; but all the
  others, more than thirty distinct species, are now living in or near the same regions. We may
  perhaps impute this difference to the fact that the migration of Southern types into this part of
  Siberia was prevented by the great mountain and desert barrier of the Central Asiatic plateau;
  whereas in Europe there was at this time a land connection with Africa. Post-pliocene deposits and
  caverns in Algeria have yielded remains resembling the more southern European types of the
  Post-pliocene period, but without any admixture of Arctic forms; showing, as we might expect, that
  the glacial cold did not <span class="pagenum" id="page112">{112}</span>extend so far south. We
  have here remains of <i>Equus</i>, <i>Bos</i>, <i>Antilope</i>, <i>Hippopotamus</i>,
  <i>Elephas</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>, <i>Ursus</i>, <i>Canis</i>, and <i>Hyæna</i>, together with
  <i>Phacoch&#x0153;rus</i>, an African type of swine which has not occurred in the European
  deposits.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is perhaps to the earlier portion of this period that the <i>Merycotherium</i>
  of the Siberian drift belongs. This was an animal related to the living camel, thus supporting the
  view that the <i>Camelidæ</i> are essentially denizens of the extra-tropical zone.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Pliocene Period.</span></p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;We here first meet with evidence of the existence of monkeys in Central
  Europe. Species of <i>Macacus</i> have left remains not only in the Newer Pliocene of the Val
  d'Arno in Italy, but in beds of the same age at Grays in Essex; while <i>Semnopithecus</i> and
  <i>Cercopithecus</i>, genera now confined to the Oriental and Ethiopian regions respectively, have
  been found in the Pliocene deposits of the South of France and Italy.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;Most of the genera which occurred in the Post-Pliocene are found here
  also, and many of the same species. Few new forms appear, except <i>Hyænarctos</i>, a large bear
  with characters approaching the hyænas, and <i>Pristiphoca</i>, a new form of seal, both from the
  Older Pliocene of France; and <i>Galecynus</i>, a fox-like animal intermediate between
  <i>Canis</i> and <i>Viverra</i>, from the Pliocene of &#x0152;ninghen in Switzerland.</p>

  <p><i>Cetacea.</i>&mdash;Species of <i>Balæna</i>, <i>Physeter</i>, and <i>Delphinus</i> occur in
  the Older Pliocene of England and France, and with these the remains of many extinct forms,
  <i>Balænodon</i> and <i>Hoplocetus</i> (Balænidæ); <i>Belemnoziphius</i> and <i>Choneziphius</i>
  (Hyperoodontidæ), and <i>Halitherium</i>, an extinct form of the next order&mdash;Sirenia, now
  confined to the tropics, although the recently extinct <i>Rytina</i> of the N. W. Pacific shows
  that it is also adapted for temperate climates.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;The Pliocene deposits are not very rich in this order. The horses
  (<i>Equidæ</i>) are represented by the genus <i>Equus</i>; and here we first meet with
  <i>Hipparion</i>, in which small lateral toes appear. Both genera occur in British deposits of
  this age. <span class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>A more interesting fact for us is the
  occurrence of the genus <i>Tapirus</i> in the Newer Pliocene of France and in the older beds of
  both France and England, since this genus is now isolated in the remotest parts of the eastern and
  western tropics. The genera <i>Rhinoceros</i>, <i>Hippopotamus</i>, and <i>Sus</i>, occur here as
  in the preceding epoch.</p>

  <p>We next come to the deer genus (<i>Cervus</i>), which appears to have been at its maximum in
  this period, no less than eight species occurring in the Norwich Crag, and Forest-beds. Among the
  Bovidæ, the antelopes, ox, and bison, are the only forms represented here, as in the Post-Pliocene
  period. Passing on to the Proboscidea, we find three species of elephants and two of
  <i>Mastodon</i> preserved in European beds of this period, all distinct from those of
  Post-Pliocene times.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;In this order we find representatives of many living European forms; as
  <i>Cricetus</i> (hamster), <i>Arvicola</i> (vole), <i>Castor</i> (beaver), <i>Arctomys</i>
  (marmot), <i>Hystrix</i> (porcupine), <i>Lepus</i> (hare), and <i>Lagomys</i> (pika); and a few
  that are extinct, the most important being <i>Chalicomys</i>, allied to the beaver; and
  <i>Issiodromys</i>, said to come nearest to the remarkable <i>Pedetes</i> of South Africa, both
  found in the Pliocene formations of France.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>General Conclusions as to Pliocene and Post-Pliocene Faunas of
  Europe.</i>&mdash;This completes the series of fossil forms of the Pliocene deposits of Europe.
  They show us that the presence of numerous large carnivora and ungulates (now almost wholly
  tropical) in the Post-Pliocene period, was due to no exceptional or temporary cause, but was the
  result of a natural succession from similar races which had inhabited the same countries for long
  preceding ages. In order to understand the vast periods of time covered by the Pliocene and
  Post-Pliocene formations, the works of Sir Charles Lyell must be studied. We shall then come to
  see, that the present condition of the fauna of Europe is wholly new and exceptional. For a long
  succession of ages, various forms of monkeys, hyænas, lions, horses, hipparions, tapirs,
  rhinoceroses, hippopotami, elephants, mastodons, deer, and antelopes, together <span
  class="pagenum" id="page114">{114}</span>with almost all the forms now living, produced a rich and
  varied fauna such as we now see only in the open country of tropical Africa. During all this
  period we have no reason to believe that the climate or other physical conditions of Europe were
  more favourable to the existence of these animals than now. We must look upon them, therefore, as
  true indigenes of the country, and their comparatively recent extinction or banishment as a
  remarkable phenomenon for which there must have been some adequate cause. What this cause was we
  can only conjecture; but it seems most probable that it was due to the combined action of the
  Glacial period, and the subsidence of large areas of land once connecting Europe with Africa. The
  existence, in the small island of Malta, of no less than three extinct species of elephant (two of
  very small stature), of a gigantic dormouse, an extinct hippopotamus, and other mammalia, together
  with the occurrence of remains of hippopotamus in the caves of Gibraltar, indicate very clearly
  that during the Pliocene epoch, and perhaps during a considerable part of the Post-Pliocene, a
  connection existed between South Europe and North Africa in at least these two localities. At the
  same time we have every reason to believe that Britain was united to the Continent, what is now
  the German Ocean constituting a great river-valley. During the height of the Glacial epoch, these
  large animals would probably retire into this Mediterranean land and into North Africa, making
  annual migrations northwards during the summer. But as the connecting land sank and became
  narrower and narrower, the migrating herds would diminish, and at last cease altogether; and when
  the glacial cold had passed away would be altogether prevented from returning to their former
  haunts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Miocene Period.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">We now come to a period which was wonderfully rich in all forms of life, and of
  which the geological record is exceptionally complete. Various lacustrine, estuarine, and other
  deposits in Europe, North India, and North America, have furnished such a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115">{115}</span>vast number of remains of extinct mammalia, as to solve many zoological
  problems, and to throw great light on the early distribution and centres of dispersal of various
  groups of animals. In order to show the bearing of these remains on our special subject, we will
  first give an account of the extinct fauna of Greece, of the Upper Miocene period; since this,
  being nearest to Africa and Asia, best exhibits the relations of the old European fauna to those
  countries. We shall then pass to the Miocene fauna of France and Central Europe; and conclude with
  the remarkable Siwalik and other Indian extinct faunas, which throw an additional light on the
  early history of the animal life of the great old-world continents.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Extinct Animals of Greece.</i></p>

  <p>These are from the Upper Miocene deposits at Pikermi, near Athens, and were collected by M.
  Gaudry a few years ago. They comprise ten living and eighteen extinct genera of mammalia, with a
  few birds and reptiles.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;These are represented by <i>Mesopithecus</i>, a genus believed to be
  intermediate between the two Indian genera of monkeys, <i>Semnopithecus</i> and
  <i>Macacus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;These were abundant. Of <i>Felis</i> there were four species, ranging
  from the size of a cat to that of a jaguar, a large <i>hyæna</i>, and a large weasel
  (<i>Mustela</i>). Besides these there were the huge <i>Machairodus</i>, larger than any existing
  lion or tiger, and with enormously developed canine teeth; <i>Hyænictis</i> and <i>Lycæna</i>,
  extinct forms of Hyænidæ; <i>Thalassictis</i>=<i>Ictitherium</i>, an extinct genus of Viverridæ
  but with resemblances to the hyænas, represented by three species, some of which were larger than
  any existing Viverridæ; <i>Promephytis</i>, an extinct form of Mustelidæ, having resemblances to
  the European marten, to the otters, and to the S. African <i>Zorilla</i>; and lastly,
  <i>Simocyon</i>, an extraordinary carnivore of the size of a small panther, but having the canines
  of a cat, the molars of a dog, and the jaws shaped like those of a bear.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;These are numerous and very <i>interesting</i>. The Equidæ are
  represented by the three-toed <i>Hipparion</i>, which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116">{116}</span>continued to exist till the Older Pliocene period. There are three large
  species of <i>Rhinoceros</i>, as well as a species of the extinct genus <i>Leptodon</i> of smaller
  size. Remains of a very large wild boar (<i>Sus</i>) were found. Very interesting is the
  occurrence of a species of giraffe (<i>Camelopardalis</i>) as tall as the African species but more
  slender; and also an extinct genus <i>Helladotherium</i>, not quite so tall as the giraffe but
  much more robust, and showing some approach to the Antilopidæ in its dentition. Antelopes were
  abundant, ranging from the size of the gazelle to that of the largest living species. Three or
  four seem referable to living genera, but the majority are of extinct types, and are classed in
  the genera <i>Palæotragus</i>, <i>Palæoryx</i>, <i>Tragocerus</i>, and <i>Palæoreas</i>; while
  <i>Dremotherium</i> is an ancient generalized form of <i>Cervidæ</i> or deer.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;These are represented by two species of <i>Mastodon</i>, and two of
  <i>Dinotherium</i>, an extraordinary extinct form supposed to be, to some extent, intermediate
  between the elephants and the aquatic manatees (<i>Sirenia</i>.)</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;This order is represented by a species of <i>Hystrix</i>, larger than
  living porcupines.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;This order, now almost confined to South America, was represented in the
  Miocene period by several European species. <i>Ancylotherium</i> and <i>Macrotherium</i>,
  belonging to an extinct family but remotely allied to the African ant-bear (<i>Orycteropus</i>),
  occur in Greece.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Species of <i>Phasianus</i> and <i>Gallus</i> were found; the latter
  especially interesting as being now confined to India.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;These are few and unimportant, consisting of a tortoise (<i>Testudo</i>)
  and a large lizard allied to <i>Varanus</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Summary of the Miocene Fauna of Greece.</i>&mdash;Although we cannot consider
  that the preceding enumeration gives us by any means a complete view of the actual inhabitants of
  this part of Europe during the later portion of the Miocene period, we yet obtain some important
  information. The resemblance that appeared in the Pliocene fauna of Europe, to that of the open
  country of tropical Africa, is now still more remarkable. We <span class="pagenum"
  id="page117">{117}</span>not only find great felines, surpassing in size and destructive power the
  lions and leopards of Africa, with hyænas of a size and in a variety not to be equalled now, but
  also huge rhinoceroses and elephants, two forms of giraffes, and a host of antelopes, which, from
  the sample here obtained, were probably quite as numerous and varied as they now are in Africa.
  Joined with this abundance of antelopes we have the absence of deer, which probably indicates that
  the country was open and somewhat of a desert character, since there were deer in other parts of
  Europe at this epoch. The occurrence of but a single species of monkey is also favourable to this
  view, since a well-wooded country would most likely have supplied many forms of these animals.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Miocene Fauna of Central and Western Europe.</i></p>

  <p>We have now to consider the Miocene fauna of Europe generally, of which we have very full
  information from numerous deposits of this age in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and
  Hungary.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;Three distinct forms of monkeys have been found in Europe&mdash;in the
  South of France, in Switzerland, and Wurtemberg; one was very like <i>Colobus</i> or
  <i>Semnopithecus</i>; the others&mdash;<i>Pliopithecus</i> and <i>Dryopithecus</i>&mdash;were of
  higher type, and belonged to the anthropomorphous apes, being nearest to the genus
  <i>Hylobates</i> or gibbons. Both have occurred in the South of France. The <i>Dryopithecus</i>
  was a very large animal (equal to the gorilla), and M. Lartet considers that in the character of
  its dentition it approached nearer to man than any of the existing anthropoid apes.</p>

  <p><i>Insectivora.</i>&mdash;These small animals are represented by numerous remains belonging to
  four families and a dozen genera. Of <i>Erinaceus</i> (hedgehog) several species are found in the
  Upper Miocene; and in the Lower Miocene of Auvergne two extinct genera of the same
  family&mdash;<i>Amphechinus</i> and <i>Tetracus</i>&mdash;have been discovered. Several species of
  <i>Talpa</i> (mole) occur in the Upper Miocene of France, while the extinct <i>Dinylus</i> is from
  Germany, and <i>Palæospalax</i> from the Lower Miocene of the Isle of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page118">{118}</span>Wight. The Malayan family Tupaiidæ or squirrel-shrews, is believed to be
  represented by <i>Oxygomphus</i>, a fossil discovered in South Germany (Wiesenau) by H. von Meyer.
  The Soricidæ or shrews, are represented by several extinct genera&mdash;<i>Plesiosorex</i>,
  <i>Mysarachne</i> and <i>Galeospalax</i>; as well as by <i>Amphisorex</i> and <i>Myogale</i> still
  living. <i>Echinogale</i>, a genus of Centetidæ now confined to Madagascar, is said to occur in
  the Lower Miocene of Auvergne, a most interesting determination, if correct, as it would form a
  transition to the <i>Solenodon</i> of the Antilles belonging to the same family; but I am informed
  by Prof. Flower that the affinities of the animals described under this name are very
  doubtful.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;Besides <i>Felis</i> and <i>Machairodus</i>, which extend back to the
  Upper Miocene, there are two other genera of Felidæ, <i>Pseudælurus</i> in the Upper Miocene of
  France, and <i>Hyænodon</i>, which occurs in the Upper and Lower Miocene of France, named from
  some resemblance in its teeth to the hyænas, and considered by some Palæontologists to form a
  distinct family, Hyænodontidæ. The Viverridæ, or civets, were very numerous, consisting of the
  living genus <i>Viverra</i>, and three extinct forms&mdash;<i>Thalassictis</i>=<i>Ictitherium</i>,
  as large as a panther, and <i>Soricictis</i>, a smaller form, occurring both in France and
  Hungary. Of <i>Hyænidæ</i>, there was the living genus <i>Hyæna</i>, and the extinct
  <i>Hyænictis</i>, which has occurred in Hungary as well as in Greece. The Canidæ, or wolf and fox
  family, were represented by <i>Pseudocyon</i>, near to <i>Canis</i>; <i>Hemicyon</i>, intermediate
  between dogs and gluttons; and <i>Amphicyon</i>, of which several species occur in the Upper and
  Lower Miocene of France, some of them larger than a tiger. The Mustelidæ, or weasels, were
  represented by five genera, the existing genera <i>Lutra</i> (otter) and <i>Mustela</i> (weasel);
  <i>Potamotherium</i>, an extinct form of otter; <i>Taxodon</i>, allied to the badger and otter;
  <i>Palæomephitis</i> in Germany, and the <i>Promephytis</i> (already noticed) in Greece. The bears
  were represented only by <i>Hyænarctos</i>, which has been noticed as occurring in the Pliocene,
  and first appears in the Upper Miocene of France. Seals are represented by a form resembling the
  Antarctic <i>Otaria</i>, remains of which occur in the Upper Miocene of France.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page119">{119}</span></div>

  <p><i>Cetacea</i> (whales).&mdash;These occur frequently in the Miocene deposits, four living, and
  five extinct genera having been described; but these marine forms are not of much importance for
  our purpose.</p>

  <p><i>Sirenia</i> (sea-cows).&mdash;These are represented by two extinct genera,
  <i>Halitherium</i> and <i>Trachytherium</i>. Several species of the former have been discovered,
  but the latter has occurred in France only, and its affinities are doubtful.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;Horses are represented by <i>Hipparion</i> and <i>Anchitherium</i>, the
  latter occurring in both Upper and Lower Miocene and Eocene; while <i>Hipparion</i>, which is more
  nearly allied to living horses, first appears in the Upper Miocene and continues in the
  Pliocene.</p>

  <p><i>Hippotherium</i>, in the Upper Miocene of the Vienna basin, forms a transition to
  <i>Paloplotherium</i>, an Eocene genus of Tapiridæ or Palæotheridæ. Tapirs, allied to living
  forms, occur in both Upper and Lower Miocene. Rhinoceroses are still found in the Upper Miocene,
  and here first appear the four-toed hornless rhinoceros, <i>Acerotherium</i>. The Suidæ (swine)
  are rather numerous. <i>Sus</i> (wild boar) continued as far back as the Upper Miocene; but now
  there first appear a number of extinct forms which have been named <i>Hyotherium</i>,
  <i>Palæoch&#x0153;rus</i>, <i>Ch&#x0153;romorus</i>, all of a small or moderate size;
  <i>Hyopotamus</i>, nearly as large as a tapir; and <i>Anthracotherium</i>, nearly the size of a
  hippopotamus and, according to Dr. Leidy, the type of a distinct family. <i>Listriodon</i>, from
  the Upper Miocene of the Vienna basin, is sometimes classed with the tapirs.</p>

  <p>We now come to a well-marked new family of Artiodactyle or even-toed Ungulata, the
  <i>Anoplotheriidæ</i>, which consisted of more slender long-tailed animals, allied to the swine
  but with indications of a transition towards the camels. The only genera that appear in the
  Miocene formation are, <i>Chalicotherium</i>, nearly as large as a rhinoceros, of which three
  species have been found in Germany and France; and <i>Synaphodus</i>, known only from its teeth,
  which differ somewhat from those of the <i>Anoplotherium</i> which appears earlier in the Eocene
  formation. Another extinct family, <i>Amphimericidæ</i> or <i>Xiphodontidæ</i>, is represented by
  two <span class="pagenum" id="page120">{120}</span>genera, <i>Cainotherium</i> and
  <i>Microtherium</i>, in the Miocene of France. They were of very small size, and are supposed to
  be intermediate between the Suidæ and Tragulidæ.</p>

  <p>The Camelopardalidæ, or giraffes, were represented in Europe in Miocene times by the gigantic
  <i>Helladotherium</i>, which has been found in the south of France, and in Hungary, as well as in
  Greece. The chevrotains (Tragulidæ) are represented by the extinct genus <i>Hyomoschus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Cervidæ do not seem to have appeared in Europe before the Upper Miocene epoch, when they
  were represented by <i>Dorcatherium</i> and <i>Amphimoschus</i>, allied to <i>Moschus</i>, and
  also by true <i>Cervus</i>, as well as by small allied forms, <i>Dremotherium</i>,
  <i>Amphitragalus</i> (in the Lower Miocene), <i>Micromeryx</i>, <i>Palæomeryx</i>, and
  <i>Dicrocerus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Bovidæ, or hollow-horned ruminants, were not well represented in Central Europe in Miocene
  times. There were no sheep, goats, or oxen, and only a few antelopes of the genus
  <i>Tragocerus</i>, and one allied to <i>Hippotragus</i>; and these all lived in the Upper Miocene
  period, as did the more numerous forms of Greece.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;The true elephants do not extend back to the Miocene period, but they
  are represented by the Mastodons, which had less complex teeth. These first appear in the Upper
  Miocene of Europe, five species being known from France, Germany, Switzerland, and Greece.
  <i>Dinotherium</i>, already noticed as occurring in Greece, extended also to Germany and France,
  where remains of three species have been found.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;A considerable number of generic forms of this order have been obtained
  from the Miocene strata. The principal genera are <i>Cricetodon</i>, allied to the hamsters,
  numerous in both the Upper and Lower Miocene period of France; <i>Myoxus</i> (the dormice) in
  France, and an allied genus, <i>Brachymys</i>, in Germany. The beavers were represented by the
  still living genus <i>Castor</i>, and the extinct <i>Steneofiber</i> in France. The squirrels by
  the existing <i>Scuirus</i> and <i>Spermophilus</i>; and by extinct forms, <i>Lithomys</i> and
  <i>Aulacodon</i>, in Germany, the latter resembling the African genus <i>Aulacodes</i>. The hares,
  by <i>Lagomys</i> and an <span class="pagenum" id="page121">{121}</span>extinct form
  <i>Titanomys</i>. Besides these, remains referred to the South American genera, <i>Cavia</i>
  (cavy) and <i>Dasyprocta</i> (agouti), have been found, the former in the Upper Miocene of
  Switzerland, the latter in the Lower Miocene of Auvergne. <i>Palæomys</i>, allied to the West
  Indian <i>Capromys</i>, has been found in the same deposits; as well as <i>Theridomys</i>, said by
  Gervais to be allied to <i>Anomalurus</i> and <i>Echimys</i>, the former now living in W. Africa,
  the latter in S. America.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;These are only represented by the <i>Macrotherium</i> and
  <i>Ancylotherium</i> of the Grecian deposits, the former occurring also in France and Germany in
  Upper Miocene strata.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Marsupials</i>.&mdash;These consist of numerous species related to the opossums
  (<i>Didelphys</i>), but separated by Gervais under the name <i>Peratherium</i>. They occur in both
  Upper and Lower Miocene beds.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Upper Miocene Deposits of the Siwalik Hills and other Localities in N. W.
  India.</i></p>

  <p>These remarkable fresh-water deposits form a range of hills at the foot of the Himalayas, a
  little south of Simla. They were investigated for many years by Sir P. Cautley and Dr. Falconer,
  and add greatly to our knowledge of the early fauna of the Old World continent.</p>

  <p><i>Primates</i>.&mdash;Remains of the genera <i>Semnopithecus</i> and <i>Macacus</i> were
  found, with other forms of intermediate character; and some teeth indicated animals allied to the
  orang-utan of Borneo, and of similar size.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora</i>.&mdash;These consisted of species of <i>Felis</i> and <i>Machairodus</i> of
  large size; <i>Hyæna</i>, <i>Canis</i>, <i>Mellivora</i>, and an allied genus <i>Ursitaxus</i>;
  <i>Ursus</i>, in the deposits of the Nerbudda valley (of Pliocene age); <i>Hyænarctos</i> as large
  as the cave bear; <i>Amphicyon</i> of the size of a polar bear (in the deposits of the Indus
  valley, west of Cashmere); <i>Lutra</i>, and an extinct allied genus <i>Enhydrion</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata</i>.&mdash;These are very numerous, and constitute the most important feature of
  this ancient fauna. Horses are represented by a species of <i>Equus</i> from the Siwalik Hills and
  the Irawaddy <span class="pagenum" id="page122">{122}</span>deposits in Burmah, and by two others
  from the Pliocene of the Nerbudda Valley; while <i>Hippotherium</i>&mdash;a slender, antelope-like
  animal, found in the Siwalik Hills and in Europe&mdash;is supposed to form a transition from the
  Equidæ to the Tapiridæ. These latter are found in the Upper Indus deposits, where there is a
  species of <i>Tapirus</i>, and one of an extinct genus <i>Antelotherium</i>. Of <i>Rhinoceros</i>,
  five extinct species have been found&mdash;in the Siwalik Hills, in Perim Island, and one at an
  elevation of 16,000 feet in the deserts of Thibet. <i>Hippopotamus</i> occurs in the Pliocene of
  the Nerbudda, and is represented in the older Miocene deposits by <i>Hexaprotodon</i>, of which
  three species have been found in various parts of India. Another remarkable genus,
  <i>Merycopotamus</i>, connects <i>Hippopotamus</i> with <i>Anthracotherium</i>, one of the extinct
  European forms allied to the swine. These last are represented by several large species of
  <i>Sus</i>, and by the extinct European genus <i>Ch&#x0153;rotherium</i>.</p>

  <p>The extinct Anoplotheridæ are represented by a species of the European genus
  <i>Chalicotherium</i>, larger than a horse.</p>

  <p>An extinct camel, larger than the living species, was found in the Siwalik Hills.</p>

  <p>Three species of deer (<i>Cervus</i>) have been found in the Siwaliks, and one in the Nerbudda
  deposits.</p>

  <p>A large and a small species of giraffe (<i>Camelopardalis</i>) were found in the Siwalik Hills
  and at Perim Island.</p>

  <p>The Bovidæ are represented by numerous species of <i>Bos</i>, and by the extinct genera
  <i>Hemibos</i> and <i>Amphibos</i>. There are also three species of antelopes, one of which is
  allied to the African <i>Alcephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>We now come to an extraordinary group of extinct animals, probably forming a new family
  intermediate between the antelope and the giraffe. The <i>Sivatherium</i> was an enormous
  four-horned ruminant, larger than a rhinoceros. It had a short trunk like a tapir, the lower horns
  on the forehead were simple, the upper pair palmated. The <i>Bramatherium</i>, an allied form from
  Perim Island, showed somewhat more affinity for the giraffe.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;No less than seven species of elephants and four <span
  class="pagenum" id="page123">{123}</span>of mastodons ranged over India, their remains being found
  in all the deposits from the Siwalik Hills to Burmah. A large <i>Dinotherium</i> has also been
  found at Perim Island.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Many remains of birds were found, but these have not been determined.
  Reptiles were numerous and interesting, the most remarkable being the huge tortoise,
  <i>Colossochelys</i>, whose shell was twelve feet long and head and neck eight feet more. Other
  small tortoises of the genera <i>Testudo</i>, <i>Emys</i>, <i>Trionyx</i> and <i>Emydida</i> were
  found, the Emys being a living species. There were three extinct and one living species of
  crocodile, and one of them was larger than any now living. The only other reptile of importance
  was a large lizard of the genus <i>Varanus</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>General Observations on the Miocene faunas of Europe and Asia.</i>&mdash;Comparing the three
  faunas of approximately the same period, and allowing for the necessarily imperfect record of
  each, we find a wonderful similarity of general type over the enormous area between France on the
  west and the Irawaddy river in Burmah on the east. We may even extend our comparison to Northern
  China, where remains of <i>Hyæna</i>, <i>Tapir</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>, <i>Chalicotherium</i>, and
  <i>Elephas</i>, have been recently found, closely resembling those from the Miocene or Pliocene
  deposits of Europe or India, and showing that the Palæarctic region had then the same great extent
  from west to east that it has now. Of about forty genera comprised in the Indian Miocene fauna, no
  less than twenty-seven inhabited Central and Western Europe during the same epoch. The Indian
  Miocene fossils are much what we should expect as the forerunners of the existing fauna, the
  giraffes and hippopotami being the only additions from the present Ethiopian fauna. The numerous
  forms of the restricted bovine type, show that these probably originated in India; while the
  monkeys appear to be altogether of Oriental types.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In Europe, however, we meet with a totally different assemblage of animals from
  those that form the existing fauna. We find apes and monkeys, many large Felidæ, numerous civets
  <span class="pagenum" id="page124">{124}</span>and hyænas, tapirs, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
  elephants, giraffes, and antelopes, such as now characterise the tropics of Africa and Asia. Along
  with these we meet with less familiar types, showing relations with the Centetidæ of Madagascar,
  the Tupaiidæ of the Malay Islands, the <i>Capromys</i>, of the West Indies, and the <i>Echimys</i>
  of South America. And besides all these living types we have a host of extinct forms,&mdash;ten or
  twelve genera allied to swine; nine genera of tapir-like animals; four of horses; nine of wolves;
  with many distinct forms of the long-extinct families of Anoplotheridæ, Xiphodontidæ, and the
  edentate Macrotheridæ. It is almost certain that during the Miocene period Europe was not only far
  richer than it is now in the higher forms of life, but not improbably richer than any part of the
  globe now is, not excepting tropical Africa and tropical Asia.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Eocene Period.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The deposits of Eocene age are less numerous, and spread over a far more limited
  area, than those of the Miocene period, and only restricted portions of them furnish any remains
  of land animals. Our knowledge of the Eocene mammalian fauna is therefore very imperfect and will
  not occupy us long, as most of the new types it furnishes are of more interest to the zoologist
  than to the student of distribution. Some of the Eocene mammalia of Europe are, however, of
  interest in comparison with those of North America of the same age; while others show that
  ancestral types of groups now confined to Australia or to South America, then inhabited
  Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;The only undoubted Eocene examples of this order, are the
  <i>Cænopithecus lemuroides</i> from the Jura, which has points of resemblance to the South
  American marmosets and howlers, and also to the Lemuridæ; and a cranium recently discovered in the
  Department of Lot (S.W. France), undoubtedly belonging to the Lemuridæ, and which most resembles
  that of the West African "Potto" (<i>Perodicticus</i>). This discovery has led to another, for it
  is now believed that remains formerly <span class="pagenum" id="page125">{125}</span>referred to
  the Anoplotheridæ (<i>Adapis</i> and <i>Aphelotherium</i> from the Upper Eocene of Paris) were
  also Lemurs. Some remains from the Lower Eocene of Suffolk were at first supposed to be allied to
  <i>Macacus</i>, but were subsequently referred to the Ungulate, <i>Hyracotherium</i>. There is
  still, however, some doubt as to its true affinities.</p>

  <p><i>Chiroptera.</i>&mdash;In the Upper Eocene of Paris remains of bats have been found, so
  closely resembling living forms as to be referred to the genus <i>Vespertilio</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;The only feline remains, are those of <i>Hyænodon</i> in the Upper
  Eocene of Hampshire, and <i>Pterodon</i>, an allied form from beds of the same age in France; with
  <i>Ælurogale</i>, found in the South of France in deposits of phosphate of lime of uncertain age,
  but probably belonging to this period. Viverridæ (civets) are represented by two genera,
  <i>Tylodon</i>, the size of a glutton from the Upper Eocene, and <i>Palæonyctis</i>, allied to
  <i>Viverra</i>, from the Middle Eocene of France. The Canidæ (wolves and foxes) appear to have
  been the most ancient of the existing types of Carnivora, five genera being represented by Eocene
  remains. Of these, <i>Galethylax</i> and <i>Cyotherium</i> were small, and with the existing genus
  <i>Canis</i> are found in the Upper Eocene of France. <i>Arctocyon</i>, about the size of a wolf,
  is a very ancient and generalised form of carnivore which can not be placed in any existing
  family. It is found in the Lower Eocene of France, and is thus the oldest known member of the
  Carnivora.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;These are more numerous. Equidæ (horses) are represented by the Miocene
  <i>Anchitherium</i> in the Lower, and by a more ancient form, <i>Anchilophus</i>, in the Middle
  Eocene of France. Tapiridæ and Palæotheridæ were very numerous. <i>Palæotherium</i> and the allied
  genus <i>Paloplotherium</i>, were abundant in France and England in Upper Eocene times. They
  somewhat resembled the tapir, with affinities for the horse and rhinoceros. A new genus,
  <i>Cadurcotherium</i>, allied to the rhinoceros and equally large, has been found in the same
  deposits of phosphate of lime as the lemur and <i>Ælurogale</i>. In the Middle Eocene of both
  England and France are found <i>Lophiodon</i> allied to the tapir, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page126">{126}</span>but in some of the species reaching a larger size; <i>Propalæotherium</i>
  and <i>Pachynolophus</i> of smaller size and having affinities for the other genera named; and
  <i>Plagiolophus</i>, a small, slender animal which Professor Huxley thinks may have been a direct
  ancestor of the horse. In the Lower Eocene we meet with <i>Coryphodon</i>, much larger than the
  tapir, and armed with large canine teeth; <i>Pliolophus</i>, a generalised type, allied to the
  tapir and horse; and <i>Hyracotherium</i>, a small animal from the Lower Eocene of England,
  remotely allied to the tapir.</p>

  <p>Among the Artiodactyla, or even-toed ungulates, the swine are represented by several extinct
  genera, of moderate or small size&mdash;<i>Acotherium</i>, <i>Ch&#x0153;ropotamus</i>,
  <i>Ceboch&#x0153;rus</i> and <i>Dichobune</i>, all from the Upper and the last also from the
  Middle Eocene of France; but <i>Eutelodon</i>, from the phosphate of lime deposits is large. The
  <i>Dichobune</i> was the most generalised type, presenting the characters of many of the other
  genera combined, and was believed by Dr. Falconer to approach the musk-deer. The
  <i>Cainotherium</i> of the Miocene also occurs here, and an allied genus <i>Plesiomeryx</i> from
  the same deposits as <i>Euteledon</i>.</p>

  <p>The Eocene Anoplotheridæ were numerous. The <i>Anoplotherium</i> was a two-toed, long-tailed
  Pachyderm, ranging from the size of a hog to that of an ass; the allied <i>Eurytherium</i> was
  four-toed; and there are one or two others of doubtful affinity. All are from the Upper Eocene of
  France and England.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;Remains referred to the genera <i>Myoxus</i> (dormouse) and
  <i>Sciurus</i> (squirrel) have been found in the Upper Eocene of France; as well as
  <i>Plesiarctomys</i>, an extinct genus between the marmots and squirrels. The Miocene
  <i>Theridomys</i> is also found here.</p>

  <p><i>Marsupials.</i>&mdash;The <i>Didelphys</i> (opossum) of Cuvier, now referred to an extinct
  genus <i>Peratherium</i>, is found in the Upper Eocene of France and England.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>General Considerations on the Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Europe.</i>&mdash;It is a curious
  fact that no family, and hardly a genus, of European mammalia occurs in the Pliocene deposits,
  without extending back also into those of Miocene age. There are, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page127">{127}</span>however, a few groups which, seem to be late developments or recent
  importations into the Palæarctic region, as they occur only in Post-Pliocene deposits. The most
  important of these are the badger, glutton, elk, reindeer, chamois, goat, and sheep, which only
  occur in caves and other deposits of Post-Pliocene age. Camels only occur in the Post-Pliocene of
  Siberia (<i>Merycotherium</i>), although a true <i>Camelus</i> of large size appears to have
  inhabited some part of Central Asia in the Upper Miocene period, being found in the Siwalik beds.
  The only exclusively Pliocene genera in Europe are <i>Ursus</i>, <i>Equus</i>,
  <i>Hippopotamus</i>, <i>Bos</i>, <i>Elephas</i>, <i>Arvicola</i>, <i>Trogontherium</i>,
  <i>Arctomys</i>, <i>Hystrix</i> and <i>Lepus</i>; but of these <i>Equus</i>, <i>Hippopotamus</i>,
  <i>Bos</i>, and <i>Elephas</i> are found in the Miocene deposits of India. Owing, no doubt, in
  part to the superior productiveness of the various Miocene beds, large numbers of groups appear to
  have their origin or earliest appearance here. Such are Insectivora, Felidæ, Hyænidæ, Mustelidæ,
  <i>Ursus</i>, Equidæ, <i>Tapirus</i>, Rhinocerotidæ, Hippopotamidæ, Anthracotheridæ (extinct),
  <i>Sus</i>, Camelopardidæ, Tragulidæ, Cervidæ, Bovidæ, Elephantidæ, and Edentata.</p>

  <p>Groups which go back to the Eocene period, are, Primates allied to South American monkeys, as
  well as some of the Lemuridæ; bats of the living genus <i>Vespertilio</i>; Hyænodontidæ, an
  ancestral form of Carnivore; Viverridæ; Canidæ (to the Upper Eocene), and the ancestral
  Arctocyonidæ to the Lower Eocene; <i>Hyænarctos</i>, an ancestral type of bears and hyænas;
  Anchitheridæ, ancestral horses, to the Middle Eocene; Palæotheridæ, comprising numerous
  generalised forms, ancestors of the rhinoceros, horse, and tapir; Suidæ, with numerous generalised
  forms, to the Middle Eocene; Anoplotheridæ and Xiphodontidæ, ancestral families of even-toed
  Ungulates, connecting the ruminants with the swine; and lastly, several groups of Rodents, and a
  Marsupial, in the Upper Eocene. We thus find all the great types of Mammalia well developed in the
  earliest portion of the tertiary period; and the occurrence of Quadrumana, of the highly
  specialized bats (<i>Vespertilio</i>), of various forms of Carnivora, and of Ungulates, clearly
  differentiated into the odd and even-toed series, associated with such lower forms as <span
  class="pagenum" id="page128">{128}</span>Lemurs and Marsupials&mdash;proves, that we have here
  hardly made an approach towards the epoch when the mammalian type itself began to diverge into its
  various modifications. Some of the Carnivora and Ungulates do, indeed, exhibit a less specialised
  structure than later forms; yet so far back as the Upper Miocene the most specialised of all
  carnivora, the great sabre-toothed <i>Machairodus</i>, makes its appearance.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The Miocene is, for our special study, the most valuable and instructive of the
  Tertiary periods, both on account of its superior richness, and because we here meet with many
  types now confined to separate regions. Such facts as the occurrence in Europe during this period
  of hippopotami, tapirs, giraffes, Tragulidæ, Edentata, and Marsupials&mdash;will assist us in
  solving many of the problems we shall meet with in reviewing the actual distribution of living
  forms of those groups. Still more light will, however, be thrown on the subject by the fossil
  forms of the American continent, which we will now proceed to examine.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller"><span class="gsp">EXTINCT
  MAMMALIA OF THE NEW WORLD.</span></span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The discoveries of very rich deposits of mammalian remains in various parts of the
  United States have thrown great light on the relations of the faunas of very distant regions.
  North America now makes a near approach to Europe in the number and variety of its extinct
  mammalia, and in no part of the world have such perfect specimens been discovered. In what are
  called the "Mauvaises terres" of Nebraska (the dried-up mud of an ancient lake), thousands of
  entire crania and some almost entire skeletons of ancient animals have been found, their teeth
  absolutely perfect, and altogether more resembling the preparations of the anatomist, than
  time-worn fossils such as we are accustomed to see in the museums of Europe. Other deposits have
  been discovered in Oregon, California, Virginia, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah, ranging over all
  the Tertiary epochs, from Post-Pliocene to Eocene, and furnishing a remarkable picture of the
  numerous strange mammalia which inhabited the ancient North American continent.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">North America&mdash;Post-Pliocene Period.</span></p>

  <p><i>Insectivora.</i>&mdash;The only indications of this order yet discovered, consists of a
  single tooth of some insectivorous animal found in Illinois, but which cannot be referred to any
  known group.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;These are fairly represented. Two species of <i>Felis</i> as large as a
  lion; the equally large extinct <i>Trucifelis</i>, found only in Texas; four species of
  <i>Canis</i>, some of them larger <span class="pagenum" id="page130">{130}</span>than wolves; two
  species of <i>Galera</i>, a genus now confined to the Neotropical region; two bears, and an
  extinct genus, <i>Arctodus</i>; an extinct species of racoon (<i>Procyon</i>), and an allied
  extinct genus, <i>Myxophagus</i>&mdash;show, that at a very recent period North America was better
  supplied with Carnivora than it is now. Remains of the walrus (<i>Trichechus</i>) have also been
  found as far south as Virginia.</p>

  <p><i>Cetacea.</i>&mdash;Three species of dolphins belonging to existing genera, have been found
  in the Eastern States; and two species of <i>Manatus</i>, or sea-cow, in Florida and South
  Carolina.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;Six extinct horses (<i>Equus</i>), and one <i>Hipparion</i>; the living
  South American tapir, and a larger extinct species; a <i>Dicotyles</i>, or peccary, and an allied
  genus, <i>Platygonus</i>; a species of the South American llamas (<i>Auchenia</i>), and one of a
  kind of camel, <i>Procamelus</i>; two extinct bisons; a sheep, and two musk-sheep (<i>Ovibos</i>);
  with three living and one extinct deer (<i>Cervus</i>), show an important increase in its
  Herbivora.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;Two elephants and two mastodons, added to this remarkable assemblage
  of large vegetable-feeding quadrupeds.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;These consist mainly of genera and species still living in North
  America; the only important exceptions being a species of the South American capybara
  (<i>Hydroch&#x0153;rus</i>) in South Carolina; and <i>Praotherium</i>, an extinct form of hare,
  found in a bone cave in Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;Here we meet with a wonderful assemblage, of six species belonging to
  four extinct genera, mostly of gigantic size. A species of <i>Megatherium</i>, three of
  <i>Megalonyx</i>, and one of <i>Mylodon</i>&mdash;huge terrestrial sloths as large as the
  rhinoceros or even as the largest elephants&mdash;ranged over the Southern States to Pennsylvania,
  the latter (<i>Mylodon</i>) going as far as the great lakes and Oregon. Another form,
  <i>Ereptodon</i>, has been found in the Mississippi Valley.</p>

  <p><i>Marsupialia.</i>&mdash;The living American genus of opossums, <i>Didelphys</i>, has been
  found in deposits of this age in South Carolina.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Remarks on the Post-Pliocene fauna of North America.</i>&mdash;The assemblage of
  animals proved, by these remains, to have <span class="pagenum" id="page131">{131}</span>inhabited
  North America at a comparatively recent epoch, is most remarkable. In Europe, we found a striking
  change in the fauna at the same period; but that consisted almost wholly in the presence of
  animals now inhabiting countries immediately to the north or south. Here we have the appearance of
  two new assemblages of animals, the one now confined to the Old World&mdash;horses, camels, and
  elephants; the other exclusively of South American type&mdash;llamas, tapirs, capybaras,
  <i>Galera</i>, and gigantic Edentata. The age of the various deposits in which these remains are
  found is somewhat uncertain, and probably extends over a considerable period of time, inclusive of
  the Glacial epoch, and perhaps both anterior and subsequent to it. We have here, as in Europe, the
  presence and apparent co-existence in the same area, of Arctic and Southern forms&mdash;the walrus
  and the manatee&mdash;the musk-sheep and the gigantic sloths. Unfortunately, as we shall see, the
  immediately preceding Pliocene deposits of North America are rather poor in organic remains; yet
  it can hardly be owing to the imperfection of the record of this period, that <i>not one</i> of
  the South American types above numerated occurs there, while a considerable number of Old World
  forms are represented. Neither in the preceding wonderfully rich Miocene or Eocene periods, does
  any <i>one</i> of these forms occur; or, with the exception of <i>Morotherium</i>, from Pliocene
  deposits <i>west</i> of the Rocky Mountains, any apparent ancestor of them! We have here
  unmistakable evidence of an extensive immigration from South into North America, not very long
  before the beginning of the Glacial epoch. It was an immigration of types altogether new to the
  country, which spread over all the southern and central portions of it, and established themselves
  sufficiently to leave abundance of remains in the few detached localities where they have been
  discovered. How such large yet defenceless animals as tapirs and great terrestrial sloths, could
  have made their way into a country abounding in large felines equal in size and destructiveness to
  the lion and the tiger, with numerous wolves and bears of the largest size, is a great mystery.
  But it is nevertheless certain that they did so; and the fact that no such <span class="pagenum"
  id="page132">{132}</span>migration had occurred for countless preceding ages, proves that some
  great barrier to the entrance of terrestrial mammalia which had previously existed, must for a
  time have been removed. We must defer further discussion of this subject till we have examined the
  relations of the existing faunas of North and South America.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Tertiary Period.</span></p>

  <p>When we get to remains of the Tertiary age, especially those of the Miocene and Eocene epochs,
  we meet with so many interesting and connected types, and such curious relations with living forms
  in Europe, that it will be clearer to trace the history of each order and family throughout the
  Tertiary period, instead of considering each of the subdivisions of that period separately.</p>

  <p>It will be well however first to note the few American Post-Pliocene or living genera that are
  found in the Pliocene beds. These consist of several species of <i>Canis</i>, from the size of a
  fox to that of a large wolf; a <i>Felis</i> as large as a tiger; an Otter (<i>Lutra</i>); several
  species of <i>Hipparion</i>; a peccary (<i>Dicotyles</i>); a deer (<i>Cervus</i>); several species
  of <i>Procamelus</i>; a mastodon; an elephant; and a beaver (<i>Castor</i>). It thus appears that
  out of nearly forty genera found in the Post-Pliocene deposits, only ten are found in the
  preceding Pliocene period. About twelve additional genera, however, appear there, as we shall see
  in going over the various orders.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;Among the vast number of extinct mammalia discovered in the Tertiary
  deposits of North America, no example of this order had been recognized up to 1872, when the
  discovery of more perfect remains showed, that a number of small animals of obscure affinities
  from the Lower Eocene of Wyoming, were really allied to the lemurs and perhaps also to the
  marmosets, the lowest form of American monkeys, but having a larger number of teeth than either. A
  number of other remains of small animals from the same formation, previously supposed to be allied
  to the Ungulata, are now shown to <span class="pagenum" id="page133">{133}</span>belong to the
  Primates; so that no less than twelve genera of these animals are recognized by Mr. Marsh, who
  classes them in two families&mdash;Limnotheridæ, comprising the genera <i>Limnotherium</i>, (which
  had larger canine teeth), <i>Thinolestes</i>, <i>Telmatolestes</i>, <i>Mesacodon</i>,
  <i>Bathrodon</i>, and <i>Antiacodon</i> of Marsh, with <i>Notharctos</i>, <i>Hipposyus</i>,
  <i>Microsyops</i>, and <i>Palæacodon</i> previously described by Leidy;&mdash;and Lemuravidæ,
  consisting of the genera <i>Lemuravus</i> (Marsh) and <i>Hyopsodus</i> (Leidy). The animals of the
  latter family were most allied to existing lemurs, but were a more generalized form,
  <i>Lemuravus</i> having forty-four teeth, the greatest number known in the order. These numerous
  forms ranged from the size of a small squirrel to that of a racoon. It is especially interesting
  to find these peculiar lemuroid forms in America, just when a lemur has been discovered of about
  the same age in Europe; and as the American forms are said to show an affinity with the South
  American marmosets, while the European animal is most allied to a West African group, we have
  evidently not yet got back far enough to find the primeval or ancestral type from which all the
  Primates sprang.</p>

  <p>About the same time, in the succeeding Miocene formation, true monkeys were discovered. Mr.
  Marsh describes <i>Laopithecus</i> as an animal nearly the size of the largest South American
  monkeys, and allied both to the Cebidæ and the Eocene Limnotheridæ. Mr. Cope has described
  <i>Menotherium</i> from the Miocene of Colorado, as a lemuroid animal, the size of a cat, and
  perhaps allied to <i>Limnotherium</i>. More Miocene remains will, no doubt, be discovered, by
  which we shall be enabled to trace the origin of some of the existing forms of South American
  monkeys; and perhaps help to decide the question (now in dispute among anatomists) whether the
  lemurs are really Primates, or form an altogether distinct and isolated order of mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>Insectivora.</i>&mdash;This order is represented by comparatively few forms in the tertiary
  beds, and these are all very different from existing types. In the Upper Miocene of Dakota are
  found remains indicating two extinct genera, <i>Lepictis</i> and <i>Ictops</i>. In the Miocene of
  Colorado, Professor Cope has recently discovered four new genera, <i>Isacis</i>; allied to the
  preceding, but as large as a <span class="pagenum" id="page134">{134}</span><i>Mephitis</i> or
  skunk; <i>Herpetotherium</i>, near the moles; <i>Embasis</i>, more allied to the shrews; and
  <i>Dommina</i>, of uncertain affinities. Two others have been found in the Eocene of Wyoming;
  <i>Amomys</i>, having some resemblance to hedgehogs and to the Eastern <i>Tupaia</i>; and
  <i>Washakius</i>, of doubtful affinities.</p>

  <p>Far back in the Triassic coal of North Carolina has been found the jaw of a small mammal
  (<i>Dromotherium</i>), the teeth of which somewhat resemble those of the Australian
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>, and may belong either to the Insectivora or Marsupials; if indeed, at that
  early period these orders were differentiated.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;The most ancient forms of this order are some remains found in the
  Middle Eocene of Wyoming, and others recently described by Professor Cope (1875) from the Eocene
  of New Mexico, of perhaps earlier date. The former consist of three genera, <i>Patriofelis</i>,
  <i>Uintacyon</i>, and <i>Sinopa</i>,&mdash;animals of large size but which cannot be classed in
  any existing family; and two others, <i>Mesonyx</i> and <i>Synoplotherium</i>, believed by Mr.
  Cope to be allied to <i>Hyænodon</i>. The latter consist of four genera,&mdash; <i>Oxyæna</i>,
  consisting of several species, some as large as a jaguar, was allied to <i>Hyænodon</i> and
  <i>Pterodon</i>; <i>Pachyæna</i>, allied to the last; <i>Prototomus</i>, allied to
  <i>Amphicyon</i> and the Viverridæ; and <i>Limnocyon</i>, a civet-like carnivore with resemblances
  to the Canidæ.</p>

  <p>In the Miocene formations we find the Feline type well developed. The wonderful
  <i>Machairodus</i>, which in Europe lived down to Post-Pliocene times, is found in the Upper
  Miocene of Dakota; and perfect crania have been discovered, showing that the chin was lengthened
  downwards to receive and protect the enormous canines. <i>Dinyctis</i> was allied both to
  <i>Machairodus</i> and to the weasels. Three new genera have been lately described by Professor
  Cope from the Miocene of Colorado,&mdash;<i>Bunælurus</i>, with characters of both cats and
  weasels; <i>Daptophilus</i>, allied to <i>Dinyctis</i>; and <i>Hoplophoneus</i>, more allied to
  <i>Machairodus</i>. The Canidæ are represented by <i>Amphicyon</i>, which occurs in deposits of
  the same age in Europe; and by <i>Canis</i>, four species of which genus are recorded by Professor
  Cope from the Miocene of Colorado, and it also occurs in the Pliocene. The <i>Hyænodon</i> is
  represented by three species in the Miocene of Dakota and Colorado. It occurs <span
  class="pagenum" id="page135">{135}</span>also in the European Miocene and Upper Eocene formations,
  and constitutes a distinct family Hyænodontidæ, allied, according to Dr. Leidy, to wolves, cats,
  hyænas and weasels. The Ursidæ are represented by only one species of an extinct genus,
  <i>Leptarchus</i>, from the Pliocene of Nebraska. From the Pliocene of Colorado, Prof. Cope has
  recently described <i>Tomarctos</i>, as a "short-faced type of dog;" well as species of
  <i>Canis</i> and <i>Martes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;The animals belonging to this order being usually of large size and
  accustomed to feed and travel in herds, are liable to wholesale destruction by floods, bogs,
  precipices, drought or hunger. It is for these reasons, probably, that their remains are almost
  always more numerous than those of other orders of mammalia. In America they are especially
  abundant; and the number of new and intermediate types about whose position there is much
  difference of opinion among Palæontologists, renders it very difficult to give a connected summary
  of them with any approach to systematic accuracy.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the Perissodactyla, or odd-toed ungulates, we find the Equine animals remarkably
  numerous and interesting. The true horses of the genus <i>Equus</i>, so abundant in the
  Post-Pliocene formations, are represented in the Pliocene by several ancestral forms. The most
  nearly allied to <i>Equus</i> is <i>Pliohippus</i>, consisting of animals about the size of an
  ass, with the lateral toes not externally developed, but with some differences of dentition. Next
  come <i>Protohippus</i> and <i>Hipparion</i>, in which the lateral toes are developed but are
  small and functionless. Then we have the allied genera, <i>Anchippus</i>, <i>Merychippus</i>, and
  <i>Hyohippus</i>, related to the European <i>Hippotherium</i>, which were all still smaller
  animals, <i>Protohippus</i> being only 2½ feet high. In the older deposits we come to a series of
  forms, still unmistakably equine, but with three or more toes used for locomotion and with
  numerous differentiations in form, proportions, and dentition. These constitute the family
  Anchitheridæ. In the Miocene we have the genera <i>Anchitherium</i> (found also in the European
  Miocene), <i>Miohippus</i> and <i>Mesohippus</i>, all with three toes on each foot, and about the
  size of a sheep or large goat. In the Eocene of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page136">{136}</span>Utah and Wyoming, we get a step further back, several species having been
  discovered about the size of a fox with four toes in front and three behind. These form the genus
  <i>Orohippus</i>, and are the oldest ancestral horse known. Prof. Marsh points out the remarkably
  perfect series of forms in America, which, beginning with this minute ancient type, is gradually
  modified by gaining increased size, increased speed by concentration of the limb-bones, elongation
  of the head and neck, the canine teeth decreased in size, the molars becoming longer and being
  coated with cement&mdash;till we at last come to animals hardly distinguishable, specifically,
  from the living horse.</p>

  <p>Allied to these, are a series of forms showing a transition to the tapirs, and to the
  <i>Palæotherium</i> of the European Eocene. In the Pliocene we have <i>Parahippus</i>; in the
  Miocene <i>Lophiodon</i>, found in the same formation and in the Eocene of Europe, and allied to
  the tapir; and in the Eocene, <i>Palæosyops</i>, as large as a rhinoceros, which had large canines
  and was allied to the tapir and <i>Palæotherium</i>; <i>Limnohyus</i>, forming the type of a
  family Limnohyidæ, which included the last genus and some others mentioned further on; and
  <i>Hyrachyus</i>, allied to <i>Lophiodon</i>, and to <i>Hyracodon</i> an extinct form of
  rhinoceros. Besides these we have <i>Lophiotherium</i> (also from the Eocene of Europe);
  <i>Diplacodon</i> allied to <i>Limnohyus</i>, but with affinities to modern Perissodactyla and
  nearly as large as a rhinoceros; and <i>Colonoceras</i>, also belonging to the Limnohyidæ, an
  animal which was the size of a sheep, and had divergent protuberances or horns on its nose. A
  remarkable genus, <i>Bathmodon</i>, lately described by Professor Cope, and of which five species
  have been found in the Eocene of New Mexico and Wyoming, is believed to form the type of a new
  family, having some affinity to <i>Palæosyops</i> and to the extinct Brontotheridæ. It had large
  canine tusks but no horns.</p>

  <p>The Rhinocerotidæ are represented in America by the genus <i>Rhinoceros</i> in the Pliocene and
  Miocene, and by <i>Aceratherium</i> and <i>Hyracodon</i> in the Miocene. Both the latter were
  hornless, and <i>Hyracodon</i> was allied to the Eocene <i>Hyrachyus</i>, one of the
  Lophiodontidæ. In the Eocene and Miocene deposits of Utah, and Oregon, several remarkable extinct
  rhinoceroses have been <span class="pagenum" id="page137">{137}</span>recently discovered, forming
  the genus <i>Diceratherium</i>. These had a pair of nasal horns placed side by side on the snout,
  not behind each other as in existing two-horned rhinoceroses, the rest of their skeleton
  resembling the hornless <i>Aceratherium</i>. They were of rather small size.</p>

  <p>Next to these extinct rhinoceroses come the Brontotheridæ, an extraordinary family of large
  mammalia, some of which exceeded in bulk the largest living rhinoceros. They had four toes to the
  front and three to the hind feet, with a pair of large divergent horns on the front of the head,
  in both sexes. Professor Marsh and Dr. Leidy have described four genera, <i>Brontotherium</i>,
  <i>Titanotheium</i>, <i>Megacerops</i>, and <i>Anisacodon</i>, distinguished by peculiarities of
  dentition. Though most nearly allied to the rhinoceroses, they show some affinity for the gigantic
  Dinocerata of the Eocene to be noticed further on. Professor Cope has since described another
  genus, <i>Symborodon</i>, from the Miocene of Colorado, with no less than seven species, one
  nearly the size of an elephant. He thinks they had a short tapir-like proboscis. The species
  differ greatly in the form of the cranium and development of the horn-bearing processes.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We commence the Artiodactyla, or even-toed Ungulates, with the hog tribe. These are represented
  by species of peccaries, (<i>Dicotyles</i>) from the Pliocene of Nebraska and Oregon; and by an
  allied form <i>Thinohyus</i>, very like <i>Dicotyles</i>, but having an additional premolar tooth
  and a much smaller brain-cavity. From the Miocene are three allied genera, <i>Nanohyus</i>,
  <i>Leptoch&#x0153;rus</i>, and <i>Perch&#x0153;rus</i>. Professor Cope, however, thinks
  <i>Leptoch&#x0153;rus</i> may be Lemuroid, and allied to <i>Menotherium</i>. The Anthracotheridæ,
  a family which connects the Hippopotamidæ and Ruminants, and which occurs in the Miocene of Europe
  and India, are represented in America by the genus <i>Hyopotamus</i> from the Miocene of Dakota,
  and <i>Elotherium</i> from the Miocene of Oregon and the Eocene of Wyoming; the latter genus being
  sometimes classed with the preceding family, and lately placed by Professor Marsh, in the new
  order, Tillodontia. Professor Cope has since described three other genera from the Eocene of New
  <span class="pagenum" id="page138">{138}</span>Mexico: <i>Meniscotherium</i>, having resemblances
  to <i>Palæosyops</i>, <i>Hyopotamus</i>, and the Limnotheridæ; <i>Phenacodus</i>, the size of a
  hog, of doubtful position, but perhaps near <i>Elotherium</i>; and <i>Achænodon</i>, as large as a
  cow, but more hog-like than the preceding. Another new genus from the Miocene of
  Colorado&mdash;<i>Pelonax</i>&mdash;is said by Professor Cope to come between <i>Elotherium</i>
  and <i>Hippopotamus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Camelidæ are very abundant, and form one of the most striking features of the ancient fauna
  of America. <i>Procamelus</i>, <i>Homocamelus</i>, and <i>Megalomeryx</i>, are extinct genera
  found in the Pliocene formation; the first very closely allied to the Old World camel, the last
  smaller and more sheep-like. In the Miocene two other genera occur, <i>P&#x0153;brotherium</i> and
  <i>Protomeryx</i>, the former allied to both the camel and the llama.</p>

  <p>Deer are represented by a single species of <i>Cervus</i> in the Pliocene, while two extinct
  genera, <i>Leptomeryx</i> and <i>Merycodus</i>, are found in the Miocene deposits, the latter
  indicating a transition between camels and deer. Two other genera, <i>Hypisodus</i> and
  <i>Hypertragulus</i>, of very small size, are said by Professor Cope to be allied to the Tragulidæ
  and to <i>Leptomeryx</i>.</p>

  <p>The Bovidæ, or hollow-horned ruminants, are only represented in the Newer Pliocene by a single
  species of an extinct genus, <i>Casoryx</i>, said to be intermediate between antelopes and
  deer.</p>

  <p>We now come to an exclusively American family, the <i>Oreodontidæ</i>, which consisted of small
  animals termed by Dr. Leidy, "ruminating hogs," and which had some general structural resemblances
  to deer and camels. They abounded in North America during the Pliocene, and especially during the
  Miocene epoch, no less than six genera and twenty species having been discovered. <i>Merychus</i>
  contains the Pliocene forms; while <i>Oreodon</i>, <i>Eporeodon</i>, <i>Merychoch&#x0153;rus</i>,
  <i>Leptauchenia</i>, and <i>Agrioch&#x0153;rus</i> are Miocene. The last genus extends back into
  the Eocene period, and shows affinity to the European Anoplotheridæ of the same epoch.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;The Elephantidæ are only represented in America by one species of
  <i>Mastodon</i> and one of <i>Elephas</i>, in the Newer Pliocene deposits. In the Older Pliocene,
  Miocene, <span class="pagenum" id="page139">{139}</span>and Upper Eocene, no remains of this order
  have been found; and in 1869, Dr. Leidy remarked on the small average size of the extinct North
  American mammalia, which were almost all smaller than their living analogues. Since then, however,
  wonderful discoveries have been made in deposits of Middle Eocene age in Wyoming and Colorado, of
  a group of huge animals not only rivalling the elephants in size, but of so remarkable and
  peculiar a structure as to require the formation of a new order of
  mammals&mdash;Dinocerata&mdash;for their reception.</p>

  <p>This order consists of animals with generalised Ungulate and Proboscidean affinities. The lower
  jaw resembles that of the hippopotamus; they had five toes on the anterior feet and four on the
  posterior; three pairs of horns, the first pair on the top of the head, large and perhaps
  palmated, the second pair above the eyes, while the third and smallest stood out sideways on the
  snout. They had enormous upper canines, of which the roots entered the middle horn cores, no upper
  incisors, and small molars. Professor Marsh believes that they had no trunk. The remains
  discovered indicate four genera, <i>Dinoceras</i> (3 sp.), <i>Tinoceras</i> (2 sp.),
  <i>Uintatherium</i> (1 sp.), and <i>Eobasileus</i> (2 sp.). Many other names have been given to
  fragments of these animals, and even those here given may not be all distinct.</p>

  <p>Another new order, Tillodontia, recently established by Professor Marsh, is perhaps yet more
  remarkable in a zoological point of view, since it combines the characters of Carnivora, Ungulata,
  and Rodents. These animals have been formed into two families, Tillotheridæ and Stylinodontidæ;
  and three genera, <i>Tillotherium</i>, <i>Anchippodus</i>, and <i>Stylinodontia</i>. All are from
  the Eocene of Wyoming and New Jersey. Perhaps to these must be added <i>Elotherium</i> from the
  Miocene of Dakota, the other forms being all Eocene. They were mostly animals of small size,
  between that of the capybara and tapir. The skull resembled in form that of a bear; the molar
  teeth were of Ungulate type, and the incisors like those of a Rodent; but the skeleton was more
  that of the Ursidæ, the feet being plantigrade. Professor Cope has since described three new
  genera from the Eocene of New Mexico, <i>Ectoganus</i>, <i>Calamodon</i>, and <i>Esthonyx</i>,
  comprising <span class="pagenum" id="page140">{140}</span>seven species allied to
  <i>Tillotherium</i> and <i>Anchippodus</i>, and having also relations, as Professor Cope believes,
  with the South American Toxodontidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;This order is represented in the Pliocene by a beaver, a porcupine, and
  an American mouse (<i>Hesperomys</i>), all extinct species of living genera, the <i>Hystrix</i>
  being an Old World type; and Professor Cope has recently described <i>Panolax</i>, a new genus of
  hares from the Pliocene of New Mexico. The Miocene deposits have furnished an extinct genus allied
  to the hares&mdash;<i>Palæolagus</i>; one of the squirrel family&mdash;<i>Ischyromys</i>; a small
  extinct form of beaver&mdash;<i>Palæocastor</i>; and an extinct mouse&mdash;<i>Eumys</i>. The
  Eocene strata of Wyoming have lately furnished two extinct forms of squirrel, <i>Paramys</i> and
  <i>Sciuravus</i>; and another of the Muridæ (or mouse family), <i>Mysops</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Cetacea.</i>&mdash;Numerous remains of dolphins and whales, belonging to no less than twelve
  genera, mostly extinct, have been found in the Miocene deposits of the Atlantic and Gulf States,
  from New Jersey to South Carolina and Louisiana; while seven genera of the extinct family,
  Zeuglodontidæ, have been found in Miocene and Eocene beds of the same districts. Some remains
  associated with these are doubtfully referred to the Seal family (Phocidæ) among the
  Carnivora.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;Till quite recently no remains of this order have occurred in any North
  American deposits below the Post-Pliocene; but in 1874 Prof. Marsh described some remains allied
  to <i>Megalonyx</i> and <i>Mylodon</i>, from the Pliocene beds of California and Idaho, and
  forming a new genus, <i>Morotherium</i>. As these remains have only occurred to the west of the
  Rocky Mountains, and in Pliocene deposits whose exact age is not ascertained, they hardly affect
  the remarkable absence of this group from the whole of the exceedingly rich Tertiary deposits in
  all other parts of North America.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>General Relations of the extinct Tertiary Mammalia of North America and
  Europe.</i>&mdash;Having now given a sketch of the extinct Mammalia which inhabited Europe and
  North America during the Tertiary period, we are enabled by comparing them, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page141">{141}</span>to ascertain their relations to each other, and to see how far they
  elucidate the problem of the birth-place and subsequent migrations of the several families and
  genera. We have already pointed out the remarkable features of the Quaternary (or Post-Pliocene)
  fauna of North America, and now proceed to discuss that of the various Tertiary periods, which is
  closely connected with the extinct fauna of Europe.</p>

  <p>The Tertiary Mammalia of North America at present described belong to from eighty to one
  hundred genera, while those of Europe are nearly double that number; yet only eighteen genera are
  common to the two faunas, and of these eight are living and belong chiefly to the Pliocene period.
  Taking first, the genera which in America do not go back beyond the Pliocene period (ten in
  number), we find that eight of them in Europe go back to the Upper Miocene. These are
  <i>Felis</i>, <i>Pseudælurus</i>, <i>Hipparion</i>, <i>Cervus</i>, <i>Mastodon</i>, <i>Elephas</i>
  (in India), <i>Castor</i> and <i>Hystrix</i>; while another, <i>Canis</i>, goes back to the Upper
  Eocene and the tenth, <i>Equus</i>, confined to the newer Pliocene or perhaps to the Post-Pliocene
  in America, extends back to the older Pliocene in Europe. Of the seven European genera which are
  confined to the Miocene period in America, three, <i>Hyænodon</i>, <i>Anchitherium</i>, and
  <i>Lophiodon</i> go back to the Eocene in Europe; three others, <i>Machairodus</i>,
  <i>Rhinoceros</i>, and <i>Aceratherium</i>, are also of Miocene age in Europe; <i>Amphicyon</i>
  goes back to the Lower Miocene of Europe. <i>Lophiotherium</i> belongs to the Eocene of both
  countries.</p>

  <p>If we turn now to families instead of genera, we find that the same general rule prevails.
  Mustelidæ (weasels), Ursidæ (bears), true Equidæ (horses), and Bovidæ (oxen &amp;c.), go no
  further back in America than the Pliocene, while they all go back to the Miocene in Europe. Suidæ
  (swine) and Anoplotheridæ (extinct) are found in the American Miocene and in the European Eocene.
  Anchitheridæ (extinct) reach the Upper Eocene in America, while in Europe they range through
  Upper, Middle, and Lower Eocene. Cervidæ (deer) alone are Miocene in both countries. There remain
  two families in which America has the preeminence. Camelidæ (camels) were wonderfully developed in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page142">{142}</span>the American Pliocene and Miocene periods,
  abounding in genera and species; whereas in Europe the group only exists in the Post-Pliocene or
  Lower Pliocene, with one Upper Miocene species of <i>Camelus</i> in N. India. The Anthracotheridæ
  (extinct), found only in the Upper Miocene of France and India, reach even the Lower Eocene in
  America.</p>

  <p>These facts may be due, in part, to a want of strict co-ordination between the Tertiary
  deposits of Europe and North America,&mdash;in part to the imperfection of the record in the
  latter country. Yet it does not seem probable that they are altogether due South America and well
  marked differences to imperfect knowledge; yet we find such important families as the Civets,
  Hyænas, Giraffes, and Hippopotami absent from America, with the Weasels, and Antelopes almost so;
  while America possesses almost all the Camelidæ, two peculiar orders, Dinocerata and Tillodontia,
  and four remarkably peculiar families, Limnotheridæ, Lemuravidæ, Oreodontidæ and Brontotheridæ. If
  then the facts at present known represent approximately the real time-relations of the groups in
  question on the two continents, they render it probable that weasels, bears, true horses, swine,
  oxen, sheep and antelopes, originated on the Old World continent, and were transmitted to America
  during some part of the Miocene period; while camels originated in the New World, and somewhere
  about the same time passed over to Europe. Of the extinct families common to the two hemispheres,
  the Anthracotheridæ alone seem to have had an American origin. Of the genera common to the two
  countries, almost all seem to have had a European origin, the only genera of equal date being the
  two rhinoceroses and three Anchitheridæ; but if the Brontotheridæ are allied to the Rhinocerotidæ,
  these latter may have originated in America, although now an exclusively Old World type. These
  conclusions are not improbable when we consider the much greater size of the Old World continents,
  extending far into the tropics and probably <span class="pagenum" id="page143">{143}</span>always
  more or less united to the tropical areas; while the evidence of the extinct mammalia themselves
  shows, that South America has been for the most part isolated from the northern continent, and did
  not take part in the development of its characteristic Tertiary fauna.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Before speculating further on this subject, it will be well to lay before our
  readers a summary of South American palæontology, after which we shall be in a better position to
  draw correct inferences from the whole body of the evidence.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">South America.</span></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, our knowledge of the interesting fossil fauna of this continent, is almost
  wholly confined to the Post-Pliocene and Pliocene periods. A few remains have been discovered in
  deposits believed to be of Eocene age, but nothing whatever representing the vast intervening
  period, so rich in peculiar forms of animal life both in North America and Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Fauna of the Brazilian caves.</i>&mdash;What we know of the Post-Pliocene period is chiefly
  due to the long-continued researches of Dr. Lund in the caves of Central Brazil, mostly situated
  in a district near the head waters of the San Francisco river in the Province of Minas Geraes. The
  caves are formed in limestone rocks, and are so numerous that Dr. Lund visited thousands, but only
  sixty contained bones in any quantity. These caves have a floor of reddish earth, often crowded
  with bones. In one experiment, half a cubic foot of this earth contained jaws of 400 opossums,
  2,000 mice, besides remains of bats, porcupines and small birds. In another trial, the whole of
  the earth in a cavern was carried out for examination, amounting to 6,552 firkins; and, from a
  calculation made by measured samples, it was estimated to contain nearly seven millions of
  jaw-bones of cavies, opossums, porcupines, and mice, besides small birds, lizards, and frogs. This
  immense accumulation is believed to have been formed from the bodies of animals brought into the
  cavern by owls; and, as these are unsocial birds, the quantity found implies an <span
  class="pagenum" id="page144">{144}</span>immense lapse of time, probably some thousands of years.
  More than 100 species of Mammalia, in all, were obtained in these caves. Some were living species
  or closely allied to such; but the majority were extinct, and a considerable number, about
  one-fourth, belonged to extinct genera, or genera not now inhabiting South America. Stone
  implements and human remains were found in several of the caves with extinct animals. The
  following enumeration of these remains is from the corrected list of M. Gervais.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;Extinct species of <i>Cebus</i>, <i>Callithrix</i>, and
  <i>Jacchus</i>&mdash;South American genera of monkeys; with an extinct genus,
  <i>Protopithecus</i>&mdash;an animal of large size but belonging to the American family
  Cebidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Chiroptera.</i>&mdash;Species belonging to the South American Phyllostomidæ, and to two
  South American genera of other families.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;Five species of <i>Felis</i>, some allied to living animals, others
  extinct; a species of the widespread extinct genus <i>Machairodus</i>; and a small species
  referred to <i>Cynælurus</i>, the genus containing the hunting leopard now found only in Africa
  and India. Canidæ are represented by <i>Canis</i> and <i>Icticyon</i> (a living Brazilian species
  of the latter genus), and the extinct genus <i>Speothos</i>. Mustelidæ are represented by extinct
  species of the South American genera <i>Mephitis</i> and <i>Galictis</i>. Procyonidæ, by a species
  of <i>Nasua</i>. Ursidæ, by <i>Arctotherium</i>, a genus closely resembling, if not identical
  with, that containing the "spectacled bear" of Chili.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;<i>Equus</i>, <i>Tapirus</i>, <i>Dicotyles</i>, <i>Auchenia</i>,
  <i>Cervus</i>, <i>Leptotherium</i>, and <i>Antilope</i>, are the cave-genera of this order.
  <i>Equus</i> and <i>Antelope</i> are particularly interesting, as representing groups forming no
  part of existing South American zoology; while the presence also of <i>Leptotherium</i>, an
  extinct genus of antelopes, shows that the group was fairly represented in South America at this
  comparatively recent period.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;A species of <i>Mastodon</i>, found also in the Pliocene of La Plata,
  represents this order.</p>

  <p><i>Rodentia.</i>&mdash;These abound. <i>Dasyprocta</i>, <i>Cælogenys</i>, <i>Cavia</i>,
  <i>Kerodon</i>, all living genera of Caviidæ, are represented by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page145">{145}</span>extinct species. <i>Cercolabes</i>, the 'tree porcupine' (Cercolabidæ)
  has two species, one as large as a peccary; <i>Myopotamus</i>, <i>Loncheres</i>,
  <i>Carterodon</i>, are existing genera of spiny rats (Echimyidæ); and there are two extinct genera
  of the same family, <i>Lonchophorus</i> and <i>Phyllomys</i>. <i>Lagostomus</i> (Chinchillidæ),
  the viscacha of the Pampas, is represented by an extinct species. There is also an extinct species
  of <i>Lepus</i>; several species of <i>Hesperomys</i> and <i>Oxymycterus</i>; and a large
  <i>Arvicola</i>, a genus not living in South America.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;These, which constitute the great feature of the existing South American
  fauna, were still more abundant and varied in the Cave period, and it is remarkable that most of
  them are extinct <i>genera</i>. The armadillos are alone represented by living forms,
  <i>Dasypus</i>, and <i>Xenurus</i>; <i>Eurydon</i> and <i>Heterodon</i>, are extinct genera of the
  same family, as well as <i>Chlamydotherium</i>&mdash;huge armadillos the size of a tapir or
  rhinoceros, and <i>Pachytherium</i>, which was nearly as large. The ant-eaters are represented
  only by <i>Glossotherium</i>, an extinct form allied to <i>Myrmecophaga</i> and <i>Manis</i>. The
  sloths were more numerous, being represented by the extinct genera <i>Cælodon</i>,
  <i>Sphenodon</i> and <i>Ochotherium</i>, the last of large size. The huge terrestrial
  sloths&mdash;Megatheridæ, also abounded; there being species of <i>Megatherium</i> and
  <i>Megalonyx</i>, as well as the allied <i>Scelidotherium</i>, supposed to have some affinity for
  the African <i>Orycteropus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Marsupials.</i>&mdash;No new forms of these appear, but numerous species of
  <i>Didelphys</i>, all closely allied to opossums still living in South America.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The preceding sketch of the wonderful cave fauna of Central Brazil, is sufficient to show that
  it represents, in the main, a period of great antiquity. Not only are almost the whole of the
  species extinct, but there are twenty extinct genera, and three others not now inhabitants of
  South America. The fact that so few remains of the living animals of the country are found in
  these caves, indicates that some change of physical conditions has occurred since they were the
  receptacles of so many of the larger animals; and the presence of many extinct genera of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page146">{146}</span>large size, especially among the Edentata and American
  families of Rodents, are additional proofs of a very high antiquity. Yet many of these cave
  animals are closely allied to those which are found in North America in the Post-Pliocene deposits
  only, so that we have no reason to suppose the cave-fauna to be of much earlier date. But the
  great amount of organic change it implies, must give us an enlarged idea of the vast periods of
  time, as measured by years, which are included in this, the most recent of all geological
  epochs.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Pliocene Period of Temperate South America.</i>&mdash;We have now to consider the numerous
  remains of extinct animals found in various deposits in the Pampas, and in Patagonia, and a few in
  Bolivia. The age of these is uncertain; but as they are very similar to the cave-fauna, though
  containing a somewhat larger proportion of extinct genera and some very remarkable new forms, they
  cannot be <i>very</i> much older, and are perhaps best referred at present to the newer portion of
  the Pliocene formation.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;The genus <i>Machairodus</i> or sabre-toothed tigers, represents the
  Felidæ. There are several species of wolves (<i>Canis</i>); a weasel (<i>Mustela</i>); two bears
  of the Brazilian cave-genus <i>Arctotherium</i>; and the extinct European genus
  <i>Hyænarctos</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;There are two species of <i>Equus</i>, found in the Pampas, Chili, and
  Bolivia; two of <i>Macrauchenia</i>, an extraordinary extinct group allied to the tapir and
  <i>Palæotherium</i>, but with the long neck, and general size of a camel. A second species found
  on the highlands of Bolivia is much smaller.</p>

  <p>A more recent discovery, in Patagonia, is the almost perfect series of teeth of a large animal
  named <i>Homalodontotherium</i>; and which is believed by Professor Flower, who has described it,
  to have been allied to <i>Rhinoceros</i>, and still more to the Miocene <i>Hyracodon</i> from
  North America; and also to present some resemblances to <i>Macrauchenia</i>, and though much more
  remotely, to the curious genus <i>Nesodon</i> mentioned further on.</p>

  <p>The Artiodactyla, or even-toed Ungulates, are represented by a species of <i>Dicotyles</i>, or
  peccary, found in the deposits of the <span class="pagenum" id="page147">{147}</span>Pampas; by
  <i>Auchenia</i>, or llama, of which three extinct species inhabited Bolivia, in which country two
  allied but extinct genera, <i>Palæolama</i> and <i>Camelotherium</i>, have also been found. Three
  species of deer (<i>Cervus</i>), from the Pampas deposits, complete the list of Pliocene
  Ungulates.</p>

  <p><i>Proboscidea.</i>&mdash;The cave species of <i>Mastodon</i> is found also in the Pampas
  deposits, and another in the Andes of Chili and Bolivia.</p>

  <p><i>Rodents.</i>&mdash;These are not so numerous as in the caves. There are species of the
  existing genera, <i>Kerodon</i> and <i>Cavia</i> (Caviidæ); <i>Lagostomus</i> (Chinchillidæ);
  <i>Ctenomys</i> (Octodontidæ); <i>Lepus</i> (hare); <i>Hesperomys</i> and <i>Oxymycterus</i>
  (Muridæ); <i>Arvicola</i>, a genus not living in South America; and an extinct genus,
  <i>Cardiodus</i>. There is also a remarkable extinct form, <i>Typotherium</i>, larger than the
  capybara, and having affinities to Edentates and Ungulates. Three species have been found in the
  Pampas deposits.</p>

  <p><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;These are as abundant and remarkable as in the cave deposits.
  <i>Scelidotherium</i>, <i>Megatherium</i>, <i>Megalonyx</i>, <i>Glossotherium</i> and
  <i>Dasypus</i>, have already been noticed as from the Brazilian caves. We have here, in addition,
  the huge <i>Mylodon</i> allied to the <i>Megatherium</i>, and the allied
  genera&mdash;<i>Gnathopsis</i> and <i>Lestodon</i>. We then come to the huge extinct armadillos,
  <i>Glyptodon</i> and <i>Schistopleurum</i>, the former consisting of numerous species, some of
  which were as large as an elephant. Another genus, <i>Eutatus</i>, is allied to the living <span
  class="correction" title="&quot;three-handed&quot; in printed work,
  corrected by Errata">three-banded</span> armadillos; and a species of the existing genus
  <i>Euphractus</i> has been found in Bolivia.</p>

  <p><i>Toxodontidæ.</i>&mdash;There remain a number of huge animals rivalling the Megatherium in
  size, and forming the genera <i>Toxodon</i> and <i>Nesodon</i>, but whose position is doubtful.
  Several species have been found in the deposits of the Pampas and Patagonia. They are allied at
  once to Ungulates, Rodents, Edentates, and the aquatic Sirenia, in so puzzling a manner that it is
  impossible to determine to what order they belong, or whether they require a new order to be
  formed for their reception. Some are believed to date back to the Miocene period, and they
  indicate what strange forms may still be discovered, should any <span class="pagenum"
  id="page148">{148}</span>productive deposits be found in South America of middle Tertiary age.</p>

  <p><i>Pliocene Mammalia of the Antilles.</i>&mdash;These may be noticed here, as they are of
  special interest, proving the connection of the larger West Indian Islands with the Continent some
  time in the later Tertiary period. They consist of remains of two large animals belonging to the
  South American Chinchillidæ, found in cave deposits in the island of Anguilla, and forming two new
  genera, <i>Amblyrhiza</i> and <i>Loxomylus</i>; and remain allied to <i>Megalonyx</i> from Cuba,
  which have been named <i>Megalocnus</i> and <i>Myomorphus</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Eocene fauna of South America.</i>&mdash;The few remains yet discovered in the Tertiary
  deposits of the Pampas which are believed to be of Eocene age, are exceedingly interesting,
  because they show us another change in the scenery of the great drama of life; there being
  apparently a considerable resemblance, at this epoch, between South America and Europe. They
  consist of a large extinct feline animal, <i>Eutemnodus</i>; of <i>Palæotherium</i> and
  <i>Anoplotherium</i>, the well-known extinct Ungulates of the European Tertiaries, and which have
  never been found in North America; and of three genera of Rodents,&mdash;<i>Theridromys</i>,
  allied to <i>Echimys</i>, and found also in the Eocene and Miocene of France; <i>Megamys</i>,
  allied to the living <i>Capromys</i> of the Antilles, and also to <i>Palæomys</i>, an extinct form
  of the French Miocene; and a very large animal referred to <i>Arvicola</i>, a genus found also in
  the Pliocene deposits of South America, and abundant in the northern hemisphere. No Edentates have
  been found.</p>

  <p>The resemblances of this fauna to that of Europe rather than to any part of America, are so
  strong, that they can hardly be accidental. We greatly want, however, more information on this
  point, as well as some corresponding evidences as to the condition of West and South Africa about
  the same epoch, before we can venture to speculate on their bearing as regards the early
  migrations of organic forms.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>General Remarks on the Extinct Mammalian Fauna of the Old <span class="pagenum"
  id="page149">{149}</span>and New Worlds.</i>&mdash;Leaving the more special applications of
  palæontological evidence to be made after discussing the relations of the existing fauna of the
  several regions, we propose here to indicate briefly, some of the more general deductions from the
  evidence which has now been laid before our readers.</p>

  <p>The first, and perhaps the most startling fact brought out by our systematic review, is the
  very recent and almost universal change that has taken place in the character of the fauna, over
  all the areas we have been considering; a change which seems to be altogether unprecedented in the
  past history of the same countries as revealed by the geological record. In Europe, in North
  America, and in South America, we have evidence that a very similar change occurred about the same
  time. In all three we find, in the most recent deposits&mdash;cave-earths, peat-bogs, and
  gravels&mdash;the remains of a whole series of large animals, which have since become wholly
  extinct or only survive in far-distant lands. In Europe, the great Irish elk, the
  <i>Machairodus</i> and cave-lion, the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and elephant;&mdash;in North
  America, equally large felines, horses and tapirs larger than any now living, a llama as large as
  a camel, great mastodons and elephants, and abundance of huge megatheroid animals of almost equal
  size;&mdash;in South America these same megatheroids in greater variety, numerous huge armadillos,
  a mastodon, large horses and tapirs, large porcupines, two forms of antelope, numerous bears and
  felines, including a <i>Machairodus</i>, and a large monkey,&mdash;have all become extinct since
  the deposition of the most recent of the fossil-bearing strata. This is certainly not a great
  while ago, geologically; and it is <i>almost</i> certain that this great organic revolution,
  implying physical changes of such vast proportions that they must have been due to causes of
  adequate intensity and proportionate range, has taken place since man lived on the earth. This is
  proved to have been the case in Europe, and is supported by much evidence both as regards North
  and South America.</p>

  <p>It is clear that so complete and sudden a change in the higher forms of life, does not
  represent the normal state of things. Species and genera have not, at all times, become so rapidly
  extinct. The time occupied by the "Recent period," that is the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page150">{150}</span>time <i>since</i> these changes took place is, geologically, minute. The
  time of the whole of the Post-Pliocene period, as measured by the amount of physical and
  <i>general</i> organic change known to have taken place, is exceedingly small when compared with
  the duration of the Pliocene period, and still smaller, probably, as compared with the Miocene.
  Yet during these two periods we meet with no such break in the continuity of the forms of life, no
  such radical change in the <i>character</i> of the fauna (though the number of specific and
  generic changes may be as great) as we find in passing from the Post-Pliocene to recent times. For
  example, in Central Europe numerous hyænas, rhinoceroses, and antelopes, with the great
  <i>Machairodus</i>, continued from Miocene all through Pliocene into Post-Pliocene times; while
  hippopotami and elephants continued to live through a good part of the Pliocene and Post-Pliocene
  periods,&mdash;and then all suddenly became extinct or left the country. In North America there
  has been more movement of the fauna in all the periods; but we have similar great felines, horses,
  mastodons, and elephants, in the Pliocene and Post-Pliocene periods, while <i>Rhinoceros</i> is
  common to the Miocene and Pliocene, and camels range continuously from Miocene, through Pliocene,
  to Post-Pliocene times;&mdash;when all alike became extinct. Even in South America the evidence
  is, as far as it goes, all the same way. We find <i>Machairodus</i>, <i>Equus</i>,
  <i>Mastodon</i>, <i>Megatherium</i>, <i>Scelidotherium</i>, <i>Megalonyx</i>, and numerous
  gigantic armadillos, alike in the caves and in the stratified tertiary deposits of the
  Pampas;&mdash;yet all have since passed away.</p>

  <p>It is clear, therefore, that we are now in an altogether exceptional period of the earth's
  history. We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest,
  and strangest forms have recently disappeared; and it is, no doubt, a much better world for us now
  they have gone. Yet it is surely a marvellous fact, and one that has hardly been sufficiently
  dwelt upon, this sudden dying out of so many large mammalia, not in one place only but over half
  the land surface of the globe. We cannot but believe that there must have been some physical cause
  for this great change; and it must have been a cause capable of acting almost simultaneously over
  large <span class="pagenum" id="page151">{151}</span>portions of the earth's surface, and one
  which, as far as the Tertiary period at least is concerned, was of an exceptional character. Such
  a cause exists in the great and recent physical change known as "the Glacial epoch." We have proof
  in both Europe and North America, that just about the time these large animals were disappearing,
  all the northern parts of these continents were wrapped in a mantle of ice; and we have every
  reason to believe that the presence of this large quantity of ice (known to have been thousands of
  feet if not some miles in thickness) must have acted in various ways to have produced alterations
  of level of the ocean as well as vast local floods, which would have combined with the excessive
  cold to destroy animal life. There is great difference of opinion among geologists and physicists
  as to the extent, nature, and duration of the Glacial epoch. Some believe it to have prevailed
  alternately in the northern and southern hemispheres; others that it was simultaneous in both.
  Some think there was a succession of cold periods, each lasting many thousands of years, but with
  intercalated warm periods of equal duration; others deny that there is any evidence of such
  changes, and maintain that the Glacial epoch was one continuous period of arctic conditions in the
  temperate zones, with some fluctuations perhaps but with no regular alternations of warm periods.
  Some believe in a huge ice-cap covering the whole northern hemisphere from the pole to near 50°
  north latitude in the eastern, and 40° in the western hemisphere; while others impute the observed
  effects either to glaciers from local centres, or to floating icebergs of vast size passing over
  the surface during a period of submersion.</p>

  <p>Without venturing to decide which of these various theories will be ultimately proved to be
  correct, we may state, that there is an increasing belief among geologists in the long duration of
  this ice-period, and the vast extent and great thickness attained by the ice-sheet. One of the
  most recent, and not the least able, of the writers on this question (Mr. Belt) shows strong
  reasons for adopting the view that the ice-period was simultaneous in both hemispheres; and he
  calculates that the vast amount of water abstracted from the ocean and locked up <span
  class="pagenum" id="page152">{152}</span>in mountains of ice around the two poles, would lower the
  general level of the ocean about 2,000 feet. This would be equivalent to a general elevation of
  the land to the same amount, and would thus tend to intensify the cold; and this elevation may
  enable us to understand the recent discoveries of signs of glacial action at moderate elevations
  in Central America and Brazil, far within the tropics. At the same time, the weight of ice piled
  up in the north would cause the land surface to sink there, perhaps unequally, according to the
  varying nature of the interior crust of the earth; and since the weight has been removed land
  would rise again, still somewhat irregularly; and thus the phenomena of raised beds of arctic
  shells in temperate latitudes, are explained.</p>

  <p>Now, it is evident, that the phenomena we have been considering&mdash;of the recent changes of
  the mammalian fauna in Europe, North America, South Temperate America, and the highlands of
  Brazil&mdash;are such as might be explained by the most extreme views as to the extent and
  vastness of the ice-sheet, and especially as to its simultaneous occurrence in the northern and
  southern hemispheres; and where two such completely independent sets of facts are found to combine
  harmoniously, and supplement each other on a particular hypothesis, the evidence in favour of that
  hypothesis is greatly strengthened. An objection that will occur to zoologists, may here be
  noticed. If the Glacial epoch extended over so much of the temperate and even parts of the
  tropical zone, and led to the extinction of so many forms of life even within the tropics, how is
  it that so much of the purely tropical fauna of South America has maintained itself, and that
  there are still such a vast number of forms, both of mammalia, birds, reptiles, and insects, that
  seem organized for an exclusive existence in tropical forests? Now Mr. Belt's theory, of the
  subsidence of the ocean to the extent of about 2,000 feet, supplies an answer to this objection;
  for we should thus have a tract of lowland of an average width of some hundreds of miles, added to
  the whole east coast of Central and South America. This tract would, no doubt, become covered with
  forests as it was slowly formed, would enjoy a perfectly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page153">{153}</span>tropical climate, and would thus afford an ample area for the continued
  existence and development of the typical South American fauna; even had glaciers descended in
  places so low as what is now the level of the sea, which, however, there is no reason to believe
  they ever did. It is probable too, that this low tract, which all round the Gulf of Mexico would
  be of considerable width, offered that passage for intermigration between North and South America,
  which led to the sudden appearance in the former country in Post-Pliocene times, of the huge
  Megatheroids from the latter; a migration which took place in opposite directions as we shall
  presently show.</p>

  <p><i>The birth-place and migrations of some mammalian families and genera.</i>&mdash;We have now
  to consider a few of those cases in which the evidence already at our command, is sufficiently
  definite and complete, to enable us to pronounce with some confidence as to the last movements of
  several important groups of mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>Primates.</i>&mdash;The occurrence in North America of numerous forms of Lemuroidea, forming
  two extinct families, which are believed by American palæontologists to present generalized
  features of both Lemuridæ and Hapalidæ, while in Europe only Lemurine forms allied to those of
  Africa have occurred in deposits of the same age (Eocene), renders it possible that the Primates
  may have originated in America, and sent one branch to South America to form the Hapalidæ and
  Cebidæ, and another to the Old World, giving rise to the lemurs and true apes. But the fact that
  apes of a high degree of organization occur in the European Miocene, while in the Eocene, a monkey
  believed to have relations to the Lemuroids and Cebidæ has also been discovered, make it more
  probable that the ancestral forms of this order originated in the Old World at a still earlier
  period. The absence of any early tertiary remains from the tropical parts of the two hemispheres,
  renders it impossible to arrive at any definite conclusions as to the origin of groups which were,
  no doubt, always best developed in tropical regions.</p>

  <p><i>Carnivora.</i>&mdash;This is a very ancient and wide-spread group, the families and genera
  of which had an extensive range in very <span class="pagenum" id="page154">{154}</span>early
  times. The true bears (<i>Ursus</i>) are almost the only important genus that seems to have
  recently migrated. In Europe it dates back to the Older Pliocene, while in North America it is
  Post-Pliocene only. Bears, therefore, seem to have passed into America from the Palæarctic region
  in the latter part of the Pliocene period. They probably came in on the north-west, and passed
  down the Andes into South America, where one isolated species still exists.</p>

  <p><i>Ungulata.</i>&mdash;Horses are very interesting. In Europe they date back under various
  forms to the Miocene period, and true <i>Equus</i> to the Older Pliocene. In North America they
  are chiefly Pliocene, true <i>Equus</i> being Post-Pliocene, with perhaps one or two species Newer
  Pliocene; but numerous ancestral forms date back to the Miocene and Eocene, giving a more perfect
  "pedigree of the horse" than the European forms, and going back to a more primitive
  type&mdash;<i>Orohippus</i>. In South America, <i>Equus</i> is the only genus, and is
  Post-Pliocene or at most Newer Pliocene. While, therefore, the ancient progenitors of the Equidæ
  were common to North America and Europe, in Miocene and even Eocene times, true horses appear to
  have arisen in the Palæarctic region, to have passed into North America in the latter part of the
  Pliocene period, and thence to have spread over all suitable districts in South America. They were
  not, however, able to maintain themselves permanently in their new territory, and all became
  extinct; while in their birth-place, the Old World, they continue to exist under several varied
  forms.</p>

  <p>True tapirs are an Old World group. They go back to the Lower Miocene in Europe, while in both
  North and South America they are exclusively Post-Pliocene. They occur in France down to the Newer
  Pliocene, and must, about that time, have entered America. The land connection by which this and
  so many other animals passed between the Old and New Worlds in late Tertiary times, was almost
  certainly in the North Pacific, south of Behring's Straits, where, as will be seen by our general
  map, there is a large expanse of shallow water, which a moderate elevation would convert into dry
  land, in a sufficiently temperate latitude.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page155">{155}</span></div>

  <p>The peccary (<i>Dicotyles</i>), now a characteristic South American genus, is a recent
  immigrant from North America, where it appears to have been developed from ancestral forms of
  swine dating back to the Miocene period.</p>

  <p>Antelopes are an Old World type, but a few of them appear to have entered North, and reached
  South America in late Pliocene times. Camels, strange to say, are a special North American type,
  since they abounded in that continent under various ancient forms in the Miocene period. Towards
  the end of that period they appear to have entered eastern Asia, and developed into the Siberian
  <i>Merycotherium</i> and the North Indian <i>Camelus</i>, while in the Pliocene age the ancestral
  llamas entered South America.</p>

  <p><i>Cervidæ</i> are a wide-spread northern type in their generalized form, but true deer
  (<i>Cervus</i>) are Palæarctic. They abounded in Europe in Miocene times, but only appear in North
  and South America in the later Pliocene and Post-Pliocene periods.</p>

  <p>True oxen (<i>Bovinæ</i>) seem to be an Oriental type (Miocene), while they appear in Europe
  only late in the Pliocene period, and in America are confined to the Post-Pliocene.</p>

  <p>Elephants (<i>Elephantidæ</i>) are an Old World type, abounding in the Miocene period in Europe
  and India, and first appearing in America in Post-Pliocene or later Pliocene times. Ancestral
  forms, doubtfully Proboscidean (<i>Dinocerata</i>), existed in North America in the Eocene period,
  but these became extinct without leaving any direct descendants, unless the <i>Brontotheridæ</i>
  and rhinoceroses may be so considered.</p>

  <p>Marsupials are almost certainly a recent introduction into South and North America from Asia.
  They existed in Europe in Eocene and Miocene times, and presumably over a considerable part of the
  Old World; but no trace of them appears in North or South America before the Post-Pliocene
  period.</p>

  <p class="sp4"><i>Edentata.</i>&mdash;These offer a most curious and difficult problem. In South
  America they abound, and were so much more numerous and varied in the Post-Pliocene and Pliocene,
  that we may be sure they lived also in the preceding Miocene period. A few living Edentates are
  scattered over Africa and Asia, and <span class="pagenum" id="page156">{156}</span>they flourished
  in Europe during the Miocene age&mdash;animals as large (in some species) as a rhinoceros, and
  most allied to living African forms. In North America no trace of Edentata has been found earlier
  than the Post-Pliocene period, or perhaps the Newer Pliocene on the west coast. Neither is there
  any trace of them in South America in the Eocene formations; but this may well be owing to our
  very imperfect knowledge of the forms of that epoch. Their absence from North America is, however,
  probably real; and we have to account for their presence in the Old World and in South America.
  Their antiquity is no doubt very great, and the point of divergence of the Old World and South
  American groups, may take us back to early Eocene, or even to Pre-Eocene times. The distribution
  of land and sea may then have been very different from what it is now; and to those who would
  create a continent to account for the migrations of a beetle, nothing would seem more probable
  than that a South Atlantic continent, then united parts of what are now Africa and South America.
  There is, however, so much evidence for the general permanence of what are now the great
  continents and deep oceans, that Professor Huxley's supposition of a considerable extension of
  land round the borders of the North Pacific Ocean in Mesozoic times, best indicates the probable
  area in which the Edentate type originated, and thence spread over much of the Old World and South
  America. But while in the latter country it flourished and increased with little check, in the
  other great continents it was soon overcome by the competition of higher forms, only leaving a few
  small-sized representatives in Africa and Asia.</p>

  AUSTRALIA.</span></p>

  <p>These have all been obtained from caves and late Tertiary or Post-Tertiary deposits, and
  consist of a large number of extinct forms, some of gigantic size, but all marsupials and allied
  to the existing fauna. There are numerous forms of kangaroos, some larger than any living species;
  and among these are two genera, <i>Protemnodon</i> and <i>Sthenurus</i>, which Professor Garrod
  has lately shown to have been allied, not to any Australian forms, but to the <i>Dendrolagi</i> or
  tree-kangaroos of New Guinea. We have also remains of <i>Thylacinus</i> and <i>Dasyurus</i>, which
  now only exist in Tasmania; and extinct species of <i>Hypsiprymnus</i> and <i>Phascolomys</i>, the
  latter as large as a tapir. Among the more remarkable extinct genera are <i>Diprotodon</i>, a huge
  thick-limbed animal allied to the kangaroos, but nearly as large as an elephant;
  <i>Nototherium</i>, having characters of <i>Macropus</i> and <i>Phascolarctos</i> combined, and as
  large as a rhinoceros; and <i>Thylacoleo</i>, a phalanger-like marsupial nearly as large as a
  lion, and supposed by Professor Owen to have been of carnivorous habits, though this opinion is
  not held by other naturalists.</p>

  <p>Here then we find the same phenomena as in the other countries we have already
  discussed,&mdash;the very recent disappearance of a large number of peculiar forms, many of them
  far surpassing in size any that continue to exist. It hardly seems probable that in this case
  their disappearance can have been due to the direct effects of the Glacial epoch, since no very
  extensive <span class="pagenum" id="page158">{158}</span>glaciation could have occurred in a
  country like Australia; but if the ocean sank 2,000 feet, the great eastern mountain range might
  have given rise to local glaciers. It is, however, almost certain that during late Tertiary times
  Australia must have been much more extensive than it is now. This is necessary to allow of the
  development of its peculiar and extensive fauna, especially as we see that that fauna comprised
  animals rivalling in bulk those of the great continents. It is further indicated by the relations
  with New Guinea, already alluded to, and by the general character of the various faunas which
  compose the Australian region, details of which will be found in the succeeding part of this work.
  The lowering of the ocean during the Glacial period would be favourable to the still further
  development of the fauna of such a country; and it is to the unfavourable conditions produced by
  its subsequent rising&mdash;equivalent to a depression of the land to the amount of two thousand
  feet&mdash;that we must impute the extinction of so many remarkable groups of animals. It is not
  improbable, that the disappearance of the ice and the consequent (apparent) subsidence of the
  land, might have been rapid as compared with the rate at which large animals can become modified
  to meet new conditions. Extensive tracts of fertile land might have been submerged, and the
  consequent crowding of large numbers of species and individuals on limited areas would have led to
  a struggle for existence in which the less adapted and less easily modifiable, not the physically
  weaker, would succumb.</p>

  <p>There is, however, another cause for the extinction of large rather than small animals whenever
  an important change of conditions occurs, which has been suggested to me by a correspondent,<a
  id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but which has not, I believe, been adduced by Mr.
  Darwin or by any other writer on the subject. It is dependent on the fact, that large animals as
  compared with small ones are almost invariably slow breeders, and as they also necessarily exist
  in much smaller numbers in a given area, they offer far less materials for favourable variations
  than do smaller animals. In such an extreme case as that of the rabbit and elephant, the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page159">{159}</span>young born each year in the world are probably as some
  millions to one; and it is very easily conceivable that in a thousand years the former might,
  under pressure of rapidly changing conditions, become modified into a distinct species, while the
  latter, not offering enough favourable variations to effect a suitable adaptation, would become
  extinct. We must also remember the extreme specialization of many of the large animals that have
  become extinct&mdash;a specialization which would necessarily render modification in any new
  direction difficult, since the inherited tendency of variation would probably be to increase the
  specialization in the same directions which had heretofore been beneficial. If to these two causes
  we add the difficulty of obtaining sufficient food for such large animals, and perhaps the
  injurious effects of changes of climate, we shall not find it difficult to understand how such a
  vast physical revolution as the Glacial epoch, with its attendant phenomena of elevations and
  subsidences, icy winds, and sudden floods by the bursting of lake barriers, might have led to the
  total extinction of a vast number of the most bulky forms of mammalia, while the less bulky were
  able to survive, either by greater hardiness of constitution or by becoming more or less modified.
  The result is apparent in the comparatively small or moderate size of the species constituting the
  temperate fauna, in all parts of the globe.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is much to be regretted that no mammalian remains of earlier date have been
  found in Australia, as we should then see if it is really the case that marsupials have always
  formed its highest type of mammalian life. At present its fossil fauna is chiefly interesting to
  the zoologist, but throws little light on the past relations of this isolated country with other
  parts of the globe.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Mammalian remains in the Secondary Formations.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">In the oldest Tertiary beds of Europe and North America, we have (even with our
  present imperfect record) a rich and varied mammalian fauna. As compared with our living or recent
  highly specialized forms, it may be said to consist of generalised types; but as compared with any
  primeval mammalian type, it must be pronounced highly specialised. Not only are such diversified
  <span class="pagenum" id="page160">{160}</span>groups as Carnivora, Perrissodactyle and
  Artiodactyle Ungulates, Primates, Chiroptera, Rodents, and Marsupials already well marked, but in
  many of these there is a differentiation into numerous families and genera of diverse character.
  It is impossible therefore to doubt, that many peculiar forms of mammalia must have lived long
  anterior to the Eocene period; but there is unfortunately a great gap in the record between the
  Eocene and Cretaceous beds, and these latter being for the most part marine continue the gap as
  regards mammals over an enormous lapse of time. Yet far beyond both these chasms in the Upper
  Oolitic strata, remains of small mammalia have been found; again, in the Stonesfield slate, a
  member of the Lower Oolite, other forms appear. Then comes the marine Lias formation with another
  huge gap; but beyond this again in the Upper Trias, the oldest of the secondary formations,
  mammalian teeth have been discovered in both England and Germany, and these are, as nearly as can
  be ascertained, of the same age as the <i>Dromatherium</i> already noticed, from North America.
  They have been named <i>Microlestes</i>, and show some resemblance to those of the West Australian
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>. In the Oolitic strata numerous small jawbones have been found, which have
  served to characterise eight genera, all of which are believed to have been Marsupials, and in
  some of them a resemblance can be traced to some of the smaller living Australian species. These,
  however, are mere indications of the number of mammalia that must have lived in the secondary
  period, so long thought to be exclusively "the age of reptiles;" and the fact that the few yet
  found are at all comparable with such specialised forms as still exist, must convince us, that we
  shall have to seek far beyond even the earliest of these remains, for the first appearance of the
  mammalian type of vertebrata.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Extinct Birds.</span></p>

  <p>Compared with those of mammalia, the remains of birds are exceedingly scarce in Europe and
  America; and from the wandering habits of so many of this class, they are of much less value <span
  class="pagenum" id="page161">{161}</span>as indications of past changes in physical geography. A
  large proportion of the remains belong to aquatic or wading types, and as these have now often a
  world-wide range, the occurrence of extinct forms can have little bearing on our present inquiry.
  There are, however, a few interesting cases of extinct land-birds belonging to groups now quite
  strangers to the country in which they are found; and others scarcely less interesting, in which
  groups now peculiar to certain areas are shown to have been preceded by allied species or genera
  of gigantic size.</p>

  <p><i>Palæarctic Region and N. India.</i>&mdash;In the caves and other Post-Pliocene deposits of
  these countries, the remains of birds almost all belong to genera now inhabiting the same
  districts. Almost the only exceptions are, the great auk and the capercailzie, already mentioned
  as being found in the Danish mounds; the latter bird, with <i>Tetrao albus</i>, in Italian
  caverns; and a species of pheasant (<i>Phasianus</i>) said to have occurred in the Post-Pliocene
  of France, considerably west of the existing range of the genus in a wild state.</p>

  <p>In the preceding Pliocene deposits, but few remains have been found, and all of existing genera
  but one, a gallinaceous bird (<i>Gallus bravardi</i>) allied to the domestic fowl and peacock.</p>

  <p>The Miocene beds of France and Central Europe have produced many more remains of birds, but
  these, too, are mostly of existing European genera, though there are some notable exceptions.
  Along with forms undistinguishable from crows (<i>Corvus</i>), shrikes (<i>Lanius</i>), wagtails
  (<i>Motacilla</i>), and woodpeckers (<i>Picus</i>), are found remains allied to the Oriental
  edible-nest swift (<i>Collocalia</i>) and <i>Trogon</i>; a parrot resembling the African genus
  <i>Psittacus</i>; an extinct form <i>Necrornis</i>, perhaps allied to the plantain-eaters
  (<i>Musophaga</i>); <i>Homalophus</i>, doubtfully allied to woodpeckers, and <i>Limnatornis</i> to
  the hoopoes. The gallinaceous birds are represented by three species of pheasants, some very close
  to the domesticated species; <i>Palæoperdix</i> allied to the partridges; and <i>Palæortyx</i>,
  small birds allied to the American genus <i>Ortyx</i>, but with larger wings. There are also
  species of <i>Pterocles</i> allied to living birds, and a small pigeon. There are numerous living
  genera of Accipitres; such as eagle (<i>Aquila</i>), <span class="pagenum"
  id="page162">{162}</span>kite (<i>Milvus</i>), eagle-owl (<i>Bubo</i>), and screech-owl
  (<i>Strix</i>); with the African secretary-bird (<i>Serpentarius</i>), and some extinct forms, as
  <i>Palæocercus</i>, <i>Palæohierix</i> and <i>Palæetus</i>.</p>

  <p>Aquatic and wading birds were abundant, including numerous rails, bustards, herons, sandpipers,
  gulls, divers, and pelicans. There were also many ducks, some allied to the genus
  <i>Dendrocygna</i>; the Oriental genus of storks, <i>Leptoptilus</i>; <i>Ibidipodia</i>, a
  remarkable form allied to <i>Ibis</i> and <i>Ciconia</i>; <i>Elornis</i>, near <i>Limosa</i>;
  <i>Pelagornis</i>, a large bird allied to gannets and pelicans; <i>Hydrornis</i>, allied to the
  ducks and petrels; <i>Dolichopterus</i>, allied to plovers. Perhaps the most interesting of these
  extinct birds are, however, the flamingoes, represented by forms hardly distinguishable from
  living species, and by one extinct genus <i>Palælodus</i>, which had very long toes, and probably
  walked on aquatic plants like the tropical jacanas.</p>

  <p>The Miocene beds of North India have furnished few birds; the only one of geographical interest
  being an extinct species of ostrich, not very different from that now inhabiting Arabia.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the birds of Europe at this period were very like those now living, with the
  addition of a few tropical forms. These latter were, however, perhaps more numerous and important
  than they appear to be, as they belong to inland and forest-haunting types, which would not be so
  frequently preserved as the marsh and lake-dwelling species. Taking this into consideration, the
  assemblage of Miocene birds accords well with what we know of the mammalian fauna. We have the
  same indications of a luxuriant vegetation and subtropical climate, and the same appearance of
  Oriental and especially of African types. <i>Trogon</i> is perhaps the most interesting of all the
  forms yet discovered, since it furnishes us with a central point whence the living trogons of
  Asia, Africa, and South America might have diverged.</p>

  <p>In the Eocene we find ourselves almost wholly among extinct forms of birds. The earliest known
  Passerine bird is here met with, in <i>Protornis</i>, somewhat similar to a lark, found in the
  Lower Eocene of Switzerland; while another Passerine form, <i>Palægithalus</i>, and one allied to
  the nuthatch (<i>Sitta</i>), have been <span class="pagenum" id="page163">{163}</span>discovered
  in the Upper Eocene of Paris. Picariæ of equal antiquity are found. <i>Cryptornis</i>, from the
  Paris Eocene, and <i>Halcyornis</i> from the Lower Eocene of the Isle of Sheppey, were both allied
  to kingfishers; while a form allied to <i>Centropus</i> a genus of cuckoos, or, as Milne-Edwards
  thinks, to the Madagascar <i>Leptosomus</i>, has been found in the Upper Eocene of France. Several
  <i>Accipitres</i> of somewhat doubtful affinities have been found in the same country; while
  <i>Lithornis</i>, from the Lower Eocene of the Isle of Sheppey, was a small vulturine bird
  supposed to be allied to the American group, <i>Cathartes</i>. Among the waders, some extinct
  forms of plovers have been found, and a genus (<i>Agnopterus</i>), allied to the flamingoes; while
  there are many swimming birds, such as pelicans, divers, and several extinct types of doubtful
  affinities. Most intersting of all is a portion of a cranium discovered in the Lower Eocene of
  Sheppey, and lately pronounced by Professor Owen to belong to a large Struthious bird, allied to
  the New Zealand <i>Dinornis</i> and also perhaps to the ostrich. Another gigantic bird is the
  <i>Gastornis</i>, from the Lower Eocene of Paris, which was as large as an ostrich, but which is
  believed to have been a generalised type, allied to wading and swimming birds as well as to the
  Struthiones.</p>

  <p>Beyond this epoch we have no remains of birds in European strata till we come to the wonderful
  <i>Archæopteryx</i> from the Upper Oolite of Bavaria; a bird of a totally new type, with a bony
  tail, longer than the body, each vertebra of which carried a pair of diverging feathers.</p>

  <p><i>North America.</i>&mdash;A number of bird-remains have lately been found in the rich
  Tertiary and Cretaceous deposits of the United States; but here, too, comparatively few are
  terrestrial forms. No Passerine bird has yet been found. The Picariæ are represented by
  <i>Uintornis</i>, an extinct form allied to woodpeckers, from the Eocene of Wyoming. Species of
  turkey (<i>Meleagris</i>) occur in the Post-Pliocene and as far back as the Miocene strata,
  showing that this interesting type is a true denizen of temperate North America. The other birds
  are, <i>Accipitres</i>; waders and aquatics of existing genera; and a number of extinct forms of
  the two latter orders&mdash;such as, <i>Aletornis</i> an Eocene wader; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page164">{164}</span><i>Palæotringa</i>, allied to the sandpipers, and <i>Telmatobius</i> to
  the rails, both Cretaceous; with <i>Graculavus</i>, allied to <i>Graculus</i>; <i>Laornis</i>
  allied to the swans; <i>Hesperornis</i> a gigantic diver; and <i>Icthyornis</i> a very low form,
  with biconcave vertebra, such as are only found in fishes and some reptiles&mdash;also from
  Cretaceous deposits.</p>

  <p><i>South America.</i>&mdash;The caverns of Brazil produced thirty-four species of birds, most
  of them referable to Brazilian genera, and many to still existing species. The most interesting
  were two species of American ostrich (<i>Rhea</i>), one larger than either of the living species;
  a large turkey-buzzard (<i>Cathartes</i>); a new species of the very isolated South American genus
  <i>Opisthocomus</i>; and a <i>Cariama</i>, or allied new genus.</p>

  <p><i>Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands.</i>&mdash;We have here only evidence of birds that
  have become extinct in the historical period or very little earlier. First we have a group of
  birds incapable of flight, allied to pigeons, but forming a separate family, <i>Dididæ</i>; and
  which, so far as we yet know, inhabited Mauritius, Rodriguez, and probably Bourbon.
  <i>Aphanapteryx</i>, an extinct genus of rails, inhabited Mauritius; and another genus,
  (<i>Erythromachus</i>), Rodriguez. A large parrot, said by Prof. Milne Edwards to be allied to
  <i>Ara</i> and <i>Microglossus</i>, also inhabited Mauritius; and another allied to
  <i>Eclectus</i>, the island of Rodriguez. None of these have been found in Madagascar; but a
  gigantic Struthious bird, <i>Æpyornis</i>, forming a peculiar family distinct both from the
  ostriches of Africa and the <i>Dinornis</i> of New Zealand inhabited that island; and there is
  reason to believe that this may have lived less than 200 years ago.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>New Zealand.</i>&mdash;A number of extinct Struthious birds, forming two
  families, <i>Dinornithidæ</i> and <i>Palapterygidæ</i>, have been found in New Zealand. Some were
  of gigantic size. They seem allied both to the living <i>Apteryx</i> of New Zealand and the emu of
  Australia. They are quite recent, and some of them have probably lived within the last few
  centuries. Remains of <i>Dinornis</i> have also been found in a Post-Pliocene deposit in
  Queensland, N. E. Australia<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>&mdash;a very important
  discovery, as it <span class="pagenum" id="page165">{165}</span>gives support to the theory of a
  great eastward extension of Australia in Tertiary times.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Extinct Tertiary Reptiles.</span></p>

  <p>These will not occupy us long, as no very great number are known, and most of them belong to a
  few principal forms of comparatively little geographical interest.</p>

  <p>Tortoises are perhaps the most abundant of the Tertiary reptiles. They are numerous in the
  Eocene and Miocene formations both in Europe and North America. The genera <i>Emys</i> and
  <i>Trionyx</i> abound in both countries, as well as in the Miocene of India. Land tortoises occur
  in the Eocene of North America and in the Miocene of Europe and India, where the huge
  <i>Colossochelys</i>, twelve feet long, has been found. In the Pliocene deposits of Switzerland
  the living American genus <i>Chelydra</i> has been met with. These facts, together with the
  occurrence of a living <i>species</i> in the Miocene of India, show that this order of reptiles is
  of great antiquity, and that most of the genera once had a wider range than now.</p>

  <p>Crocodiles, allied to the three forms now characteristic of India, Africa, and America, have
  been found in the Eocene of our own country, and several species of <i>Crocodilus</i> have
  occurred in beds of the same age in North America.</p>

  <p>Lizards are very ancient, many small terrestrial forms occurring in all the Tertiary deposits.
  A species of the genus <i>Chamæleo</i> is recorded from the Eocene of North America, together with
  several extinct genera.</p>

  <p>Snakes were well developed in the Eocene period, where remains of several have been found which
  must have been from twelve to twenty feet long. An extinct species of true viper has occurred in
  the Miocene of France, and one of the Pythonidæ in the Miocene brown coal of Germany.</p>

  <p>Batrachia occur but sparingly in a fossil state in the Tertiary deposits. The most remarkable
  is the large Salamander (<i>Andreas</i>) from the Upper Miocene of Switzerland, which <span
  class="pagenum" id="page166">{166}</span>is allied to the <i>Menopoma</i> living in North America.
  Species of frog (<i>Rana</i>), and <i>Palæophryus</i> an extinct genus of toads, have been found
  in the Miocene deposits of Germany and Switzerland.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fresh water fish are almost unknown in the Tertiary deposits of Europe, although
  most of the families and some genera of living marine fish are represented from the Eocene
  downwards.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Antiquity of the Genera of Insects.</span></p>

  <p>Fossil insects are far too rarely found, to aid us in our determination of difficult questions
  of geographical distribution; but in discussing these questions it will be important to know,
  whether we are to look upon the existing generic forms of insects as of great or small antiquity,
  compared with the higher vertebrates; and to decide this question the materials at our command are
  ample.</p>

  <p>The conditions requisite for the preservation of insects in a fossil state are no doubt very
  local and peculiar; the result being, that it is only at long intervals in the geological record
  that we meet with remains of insects in a recognisable condition. None appear to have been found
  in the Pliocene formation; but in the Upper Miocene of &#x0152;ninghen in Switzerland, associated
  with the wonderfully rich fossil flora, are found immense quantities of insects. Prof. Heer
  examined more than 5,000 specimens belonging to over 800 species, and many have been found in
  other localities in Switzerland; so that more than 1,300 species of Miocene insects have now been
  determined. Most of the orders are represented, but the beetles (Coleoptera) are far the most
  abundant. Almost all belong to existing genera, and the majority of these genera now inhabit
  Europe, only three or four being exclusively Indian, African, or American.</p>

  <p>In the Lower Miocene of Croatia there is another rich deposit of insects, somewhat more
  tropical in character, comprising large white-ants and dragon-flies differently marked from any
  <span class="pagenum" id="page167">{167}</span>now inhabiting Europe. A butterfly is also well
  preserved, with all the markings of the wings; and it seems to be a <i>Junonia</i>, a tropical
  genus, though it may be a <i>Vanessa</i>, which is European, but the fossil most resembles Indian
  species of <i>Junonia</i>.</p>

  <p>The Eocene formations seem to have produced no insect remains; but they occur again in the
  Upper Cretaceous at Aix-la-Chapelle, where two butterflies have been found, <i>Cyllo sepulta</i>
  and <i>Satyrites Reynesii</i>, both belonging to the Satyridæ, and the former to a genus now
  spread over Africa, India, and Australia.</p>

  <p>A little earlier, in the Wealden formation of our own country, numerous insects have been
  found, principally dragon flies (<i>Libellula</i>, <i>Æshna</i>); aquatic Hemiptera (<i>Velia
  Hydrometra</i>); crickets, cockroaches, and cicadas, of familiar types.</p>

  <p>Further back in the Upper Oolite of Bavaria&mdash;which produced the wonderful long-tailed
  bird, <i>Archæopteryx</i>&mdash;insects of all orders have been found, including a moth referred
  to the existing genus <i>Sphinx</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Lower Oolite of Oxfordshire many fossil beetles have been found whose affinities are
  shown by their names:&mdash;<i>Buprestidium</i>, <i>Curculionidium</i>, <i>Blapsidium</i>,
  <i>Melolonthidium</i>, and <i>Prionidium</i>; a wing of a butterfly has also been found, allied to
  the Brassolidæ now confined to tropical America, and named <i>Palæontina oolitica</i>.</p>

  <p>Still more remote are the insects of the Lias of Gloucestershire, yet they too can be referred
  to well-known family types&mdash;Carabidæ, Melolonthidæ, Telephoridæ, Elateridæ, and Curculionidæ,
  among beetles; Gryllidæ and Blattidæ among Orthoptera; with <i>Libellula</i>, <i>Agrion</i>,
  <i>Æshna</i>, <i>Ephemera</i>, and some extinct genera. When we consider that almost the only
  vertebrata of this period were huge Saurian reptiles like the <i>Icthyosaurus</i>,
  <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, and <i>Dinosaurus</i>, with the flying Pterodactyles; and that the great mass
  of our existing genera, and even families, of fish and reptiles had almost certainly not come into
  existence, we see at once that types of insect-form are, proportionately, far more ancient. At
  this remote epoch we find the chief family types (the <i>genera</i> of the time of Linnæus)
  perfectly differentiated <span class="pagenum" id="page168">{168}</span>and recognisable. It is
  only when we go further back still, into the Palæozoic formations, that the insect forms begin to
  show that generalization of type which renders it impossible to classify them in any existing
  groups. Yet even in the coal formation of Nova Scotia and Durham, the fossil insects are said by
  competent entomologists to be "allied to <i>Ephemera</i>," "near <i>Blatta</i>," "near
  <i>Phasmidæ</i>;" and in deposits of the same age at Saarbrück near Trèves, a well-preserved wing
  of a grasshopper or locust has been found, as well as a beetle referred to the Scarabeidæ. More
  remarkable, however, is the recent discovery in the carboniferous shales of Belgium, of the
  clearly-defined wing of a large moth (<i>Breyeria borinensis</i>), closely resembling some of the
  Saturniidæ; so that we have now all the chief orders of Insects&mdash;including those supposed to
  be the most highly developed and the most recent&mdash;well represented at this very remote epoch.
  Even the oldest insects, from the Devonian rocks of North America, can mostly be classed as
  Neuroptera or Myriapoda, but appear to form new families.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We may consider it, therefore, as proved, that many of the larger and more
  important genera of insects date back to the beginning of the Tertiary period, or perhaps beyond
  it; but the family types are far older, and must have been differentiated very early in the
  Secondary period, while some of them perhaps go back to Palæozoic times. The great comparative
  antiquity of the <i>genera</i> is however the important fact for us, and we shall have occasion
  often to refer to it, in endeavouring to ascertain the true bearing of the facts of insect
  distribution, as elucidating or invalidating the conclusions arrived at from a study of the
  distribution of the higher animals.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Antiquity of the Genera of Land and Fresh-Water Shells.</span></p>

  <p>The remains of land and fresh-water shells are not much more frequent than those of insects.
  Like them, too, their forms are very stable, continuing unchanged through several geological <span
  class="pagenum" id="page169">{169}</span>periods. In the Pliocene and Miocene formations, most of
  the shells are very similar to living species, and some are quite identical. In the Eocene we meet
  with ordinary forms of the genera <i>Helix</i>, <i>Clausilia</i>, <i>Pupa</i>, <i>Bulimus</i>,
  <i>Glandina</i>, <i>Cyclostoma</i>, <i>Megalostoma</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, <i>Paludina</i> and
  <i>Limnæa</i>, some resembling European species, others more like tropical forms. A British Eocene
  species of <i>Helix</i> is still living in Texas; and in the South of France are found species of
  the Brazilian sub-genera <i>Megaspira</i> and <i>Anastoma</i>. In the secondary formation no true
  land shells have been found, but fresh water shells are tolerably abundant, and almost all are
  still of living forms. In the Wealden (Lower Cretaceous) and Purbeck (Upper Oolite) are found
  <i>Unio</i>, <i>Melania</i>, <i>Paludina</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, and <i>Limnæa</i>; while the last
  named genus occurs even in the Lias.</p>

  <p>The notion that land shells were really not in existence during the secondary period is,
  however, proved to be erroneous by the startling discovery, in the Palæozoic coal measures of Nova
  Scotia, of two species of Helicidæ, both of living genera&mdash;<i>Pupa vetusta</i>, and
  <i>Zonites priscus</i>. They have been found in the hollow trunk of a <i>Sigillaria</i>, and in
  great quantities in a bed full of Stigmarian rootlets. The most minute examination detects no
  important differences of form or of microscopic structure, between these shells and living species
  of the same genera! These mollusca were the contemporaries of Labyrinthodonts and strange Ganoid
  fishes, which formed almost the whole vertebrate fauna. This unexpected discovery renders it
  almost certain, that numbers of other existing genera, of which we have found no traces, lived
  with these two through the whole secondary period; and we are thus obliged to assume as a
  probability, that any particular genus has lived through a long succession of geological ages. In
  estimating the importance of any peculiarities or anomalies in the geographical distribution of
  land shells as compared with the higher vertebrates, we shall, therefore, have to keep this
  possible, and even probable high antiquity, constantly in mind.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We have now concluded our sketch of Tertiary Palæontology as a preparation for the intelligent
  study of the Geographical <span class="pagenum" id="page170">{170}</span>Distribution of Land
  Animals; and however imperfectly the task has been performed, the reader will at all events have
  been convinced that some such preliminary investigation is an essential and most important part of
  our work. So much of palæontology is at present tentative and conjectural, that in combining the
  information derived from numerous writers, many errors of detail must have been made. The main
  conclusions have, however, been drawn from as large a basis of facts as possible; and although
  fresh discoveries may show that our views as to the past history of some of the less important
  genera or families are erroneous, they can hardly invalidate our results to any important degree,
  either as regards the intercommunications between separate regions in the various geological
  epochs, or as to the centres from which some of the more important groups have been dispersed.</p>

  OF SUCCESSION OF THE REGIONS.&mdash;COSMOPOLITAN GROUPS OF ANIMALS.&mdash;TABLES OF
  DISTRIBUTION.</span></span></p>

  <p>Having discussed, in our First Part, such general and preliminary matters as are necessary to a
  proper comprehension of our subject; and having made ourselves acquainted, in our Second Part,
  with the most important results of Palæontology, we now come to our more immediate subject, which
  we propose to treat first under its geographical aspect. Taking each of our six regions in
  succession, we shall point out in some detail the chief zoological features they present, as
  influenced by climate, vegetation, and other physical features. We shall then treat each of the
  sub-regions by itself, as well as such of the islands or other sub-divisions as present features
  of special interest; endeavouring to ascertain their true relations to each other, and the more
  important changes of physical geography that seem necessary to account for their present
  zoological condition.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Order of Succession of the Regions.</i>&mdash;We may here explain the reason for taking the
  several regions in a different succession from that in which they appear in the tabular or
  diagrammatic headings to each family, in the Fourth, and concluding part of this work. It will
  have been seen, by our examination of extinct animals (and it will be made still clearer during
  our study of the several regions) that all the chief types of animal life appear to have
  originated in the great north temperate or northern continents; while the southern
  continents&mdash;now represented by <span class="pagenum" id="page174">{174}</span>South America,
  Australia, and South Africa with Madagascar&mdash;have been more or less completely isolated,
  during long periods, both from the northern continent and from each other. These latter countries
  have, however, been subject to more or less immigration from the north during rare epochs of
  approximation to, or partial union with it. In the northern, more extensive, and probably more
  ancient land, the process of development has been more rapid, and has resulted in more varied and
  higher types; while the southern lands, for the most part, seem to have produced numerous
  diverging modifications of the lower grades of organization, the original types of which they
  derived either from the north, or from some of the ancient continents in Mesozoic or Palæozoic
  times. Hence those curious resemblances in the fauna of South America, Australia, and, to a less
  extent, Madagascar, which have led to a somewhat general belief that these distant countries must
  at one time or other have been united; a belief which, after a careful examination of all the
  facts, does not seem to the author of this work to be well founded. On the other hand, there is
  the most satisfactory evidence that each southern region has been more or less closely united
  (during the tertiary or later secondary epoch) with the great northern continents, leading to
  numerous resemblances and affinities in their productions.</p>

  <p>In endeavouring to present at a glance in the most convenient manner, the distribution of the
  families in the several regions and sub-regions, it was necessary to arrange them, so that those
  whose relations to each other were closest should stand side by side; the first and last being
  those between which the relations were least numerous and least important. Influenced by the usual
  opinions as to the relations between Australia and South America, the series was at first begun
  with the Nearctic, and terminated with the Australian and Neotropical regions; and it was not till
  the whole of the vertebrate families had been gone through, and their distribution carefully
  studied, that these last two regions were seen to be really wider apart than any others of the
  series. It was therefore decided to alter the arrangement, beginning with the Neotropical, and
  ending with the Australian <span class="pagenum" id="page175">{175}</span>regions; and a careful
  inspection of the diagrams themselves, taken in their entirety, will, it is believed, show that
  this is the most natural plan, and most truly exhibits the relations of the several regions.</p>

  <p>In the portion of our work now commencing, we are not, however, by any means bound to begin at
  either end of this series. Each region is studied by itself, but reference will often have to be
  made to all the other regions; and wherever we begin, we must occasionally refer to facts which
  will be given further on. As, however, the great northern continents form the central mass from
  which the southern regions, as it were, diverge, and as the Palæarctic region is both more
  extensive and much better known than any other, it undoubtedly forms the most convenient
  starting-point for our proposed survey of the zoological history of the earth. We thus pass from
  the better known to the less known&mdash;from Europe to Africa and tropical Asia, and thence to
  Australia, completing the series of regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. Beginning again with the
  Neotropical region, we pass to the Nearctic, which has such striking relations with the preceding
  and with the Palæarctic region, that it can only be properly understood by constant reference to
  both. We thus keep separate the Eastern and Western hemispheres, which form, from our point of
  view, the most radical and most suggestive division of terrestrial faunas; and as we are able to
  make this also the dividing point of our two volumes, reference to the work will be thereby
  facilitated.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Cosmopolitan Groups.</i>&mdash;Before proceeding to sketch the zoological features of the
  several Regions it will be well to notice those family groups which belong to the earth as a
  whole, and which are so widely and universally distributed over it that it will be unnecessary, in
  some cases, to do more than refer to them under the separate geographical divisions.</p>

  <p>The only absolutely cosmopolitan families of Mammalia are those which are aerial or marine; and
  this is one of the striking proofs that their distribution has been effected by natural causes,
  and that the permanence of barriers is one of the chief <span class="pagenum"
  id="page176">{176}</span>agencies in the limitation of their range. Even among the aerial bats,
  however, only one family&mdash;the Vespertilionidæ&mdash;is truly cosmopolitan, the others having
  a more or less restricted range. Neither are the Cetacea necessarily cosmopolitan, most of the
  families being restricted either to warm or to cold seas; but one family, the dolphins
  (Delphinidæ), is truly so. This order however will not require further notice, as, being
  exclusively marine the groups do not enter into any of our terrestrial regions. The only other
  family of mammals that may be considered to be cosmopolitan, is the Muridæ (rats and mice); yet
  these are not entirely so, since none are known to be truly indigenous in any part of the
  Australian region except Australia itself.</p>

  <p>In the class of Birds, a number of families are cosmopolites, if we reckon as such all which
  are found in each region and sub-region; but several of these are so abundant in some parts, while
  they are so sparingly represented in others, that they cannot fairly be considered so. We shall
  confine that term therefore, to such as, there is reason to believe, inhabit every important
  sub-division of each region. Such are, among the Passerine birds the crows (Corvidæ), and swallows
  (Hirundinidæ); among the Picariæ the kingfishers (Alcedinidæ); among other Land birds the pigeons
  (Columbidæ), grouse and partridges (Tetraonidæ), hawks (Falconidæ), and owls (Strigidæ); among the
  Waders the rails (Rallidæ), snipes (Scolopacidæ), plovers (Charadriadæ), and herons (Ardeidæ); and
  among the Swimmers the ducks (Anatidæ), gulls (Laridæ), petrels (Procellariidæ), pelicans
  (Pelecanidæ), and grebes (Podicipidæ).</p>

  <p>In the class of Reptiles there are few absolutely cosmopolitan families, owing to the scarcity
  of members of this group in some insular sub-regions, such as New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.
  Those which are most nearly so are the Colubridæ among snakes, and the Scincidæ among lizards.</p>

  <p>There is no cosmopolitan family of Amphibia, the true frogs (Ranidæ) being the most widely
  distributed.</p>

  <p>Neither is any family of Freshwater Fishes cosmopolitan, the Siluridæ, which have the widest
  range, being confined <span class="pagenum" id="page177">{177}</span>to warm regions, and becoming
  very scarce in the temperate zones.</p>

  <p>Among the Diurnal and Crepuscular Lepidoptera (butterflies and sphinges) the following families
  are cosmopolitan:&mdash;Satyridæ, Nymphalidæ, Lycænidæ, Pieridæ, Papilionidæ, Hesperidæ, <span

  <p><i>Tables of Distribution of Families and Genera.</i>&mdash;Having been obliged to construct
  numerous tables of the distribution of the various groups for the purposes of the descriptive part
  of the work, I have thought it well to append the most important of them, in a convenient form, to
  the chapter on each region; as much information will thereby be given, which can only be obtained
  from existing works at the cost of great labour. All these tables are drawn up on a uniform plan,
  the same generic and family names being used in each; and all are arranged in the same systematic
  order, so as to be readily comparable with each other. This, although it seems a simple and
  natural thing to do, has involved a very great amount of labour, because hardly two authors use
  the same names or follow the same arrangement. Hence comparison between them is impossible, till
  all their work has been picked to pieces, their synonymy unravelled, their differences accounted
  for, and the materials recast; and this has to be done, not for two or three authors only, but for
  the majority of those whose works have been consulted on the zoology of any part of the globe.</p>

  <p>Except in the two higher orders&mdash;Mammalia and Birds&mdash;materials do not exist for
  complete tables of the genera brought down to the present time. We have given therefore, first, a
  complete table of all the families of Vertebrata and Diurnal Lepidoptera found in each region,
  showing the sub-regions in which they occur, and their range beyond the limits of the region.
  Families which are wholly peculiar to the region, or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page178">{178}</span>very characteristic and almost exclusively confined to it, are in
  <i>italics</i>. The number prefixed to each family corresponds to that of the series of families
  in the Fourth Part of this work, so that if further information is required it can be readily
  referred to without consulting the index. Names inclosed in
  parentheses&mdash;(&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) thus&mdash;indicate families which only just enter
  a region from an adjacent one, to which they properly belong. The eye is thus directed to the
  more, and the less important families; and a considerable amount of information as to the general
  features of the zoology of the region, is conveyed in the easiest manner.</p>

  <p>The tables of genera of Mammalia and Birds, are arranged on a somewhat different plan. Each
  genus is given under its Family and Order, and they follow in the same succession in all the
  tables. The number of species of each genus, inhabiting the region, is given as nearly as can be
  ascertained; but in many cases this can only be a general approximation. The distribution of the
  genera within the region, is then given with some detail; and, lastly, the range of the genus
  beyond the region is given in general terms, the words "Oriental," "Ethiopian," &amp;c., being
  used for brevity, to indicate that the genus occurs over a considerable part of such regions.
  Genera which are restricted to the region (or which are very characteristic of it though just
  transgressing its limits) are given in <i>italics</i>; while those which only just enter the
  region from another to which they really belong, are enclosed in
  parentheses&mdash;(&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) thus. The genera are here numbered consecutively,
  in order that the number of genera in each family or each order, in the region, may be readily
  ascertained (by one process of subtraction), and thus comparisons made with other regions or with
  any other area. As the tables of birds would be swelled to an inconvenient length by the insertion
  in each region of all the genera of Waders and Aquatics, most of which have a very wide range and
  would have to be repeated in several or all the regions, these have been omitted; but a list has
  been given of such of the genera as are peculiar to, or highly characteristic of each region.</p>

  <p class="sp5">As this is the first time that any such extensive tables of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page179">{179}</span>distribution have been constructed for the whole of the Mammalia and
  Birds, they must necessarily contain many errors of detail; but with all their imperfections it is
  believed they will prove very useful to naturalists, to teachers, and to all who take an
  intelligent interest in the wider problems of geography and natural history.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller"><span class="gsp">THE
  PALÆARCTIC REGION.</span></span></p>

  <p class="sp5">This region is of immense extent, comprising all the temperate portions of the
  great eastern continents. It thus extends from the Azores and Canary Islands on the west to Japan
  on the east, a distance not far short of half the circumference of the globe. Yet so great is the
  zoological unity of this vast tract, that the majority of the genera of animals in countries so
  far removed as Great Britain and Northern Japan are identical. Throughout its northern half the
  animal productions of the Palæarctic region are very uniform, except that the vast elevated
  desert-regions of Central Asia possess some characteristic forms; but in its southern portion, we
  find a warm district at each extremity with somewhat contrasted features. On the west we have the
  rich and luxuriant Mediterranean sub-region, possessing many peculiar forms of life, as well as a
  few which are more especially characteristic of the Ethiopian region. On the east we have the
  fertile plains of Northern China and the rich and varied islands of Japan, possessing a very
  distinct set of peculiar forms, with others belonging to the Oriental region, into which this part
  of the Palæarctic region merges gradually as we approach the Tropic of Cancer. Thus, the countries
  roughly indicated by the names&mdash;Northern Europe, the Mediterranean district, Central and
  Northern Asia, and China with Japan&mdash;have each well-marked minor characteristics which
  entitle them to the rank of sub-regions. Their boundaries are often indefinable; and those here
  adopted have been fixed upon to some extent by considerations of convenience, dependent on custom
  and on the more or less perfect knowledge we possess of some of the intervening countries.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page181">{181}</span></div>

  <p><i>Zoological Characteristics of the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;The Palæarctic region has
  representatives of thirty-five families of mammalia, fifty-five of birds, twenty-five of reptiles,
  nine of amphibia, and thirteen of freshwater fishes. Comparing it with the only other wholly
  temperate region, the Nearctic, we find a much greater variety of types of mammalia and birds.
  This may be due in part to its greater area, but more, probably, to its southern boundary being
  conterminous for an enormous distance with two tropical regions, the Ethiopean and Oriental;
  whereas the Nearctic has a comparatively short southern boundary conterminous with the Neotropical
  region only. This is so very important a difference, that it is rather a matter of surprise that
  the two north temperate regions should not be more unequal in the number of their higher
  vertebrate forms, than they actually are.</p>

  <p>It is also to the interblending of the Palæarctic with the two adjacent tropical regions, that
  we must attribute its possession of so few peculiar family groups. These are only three; two of
  reptiles, <i>Trogonophidæ</i> and <i>Ophiomoridæ</i>, and one of fishes, <i>Comephoridæ</i>. The
  number of peculiar genera is, however, considerable, as the following enumeration will show.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The monkey of Gibraltar and North Africa, and an allied species found in
  Japan, are now considered to belong to the extensive eastern genus <i>Macacus</i>. The former,
  however, is peculiar in the entire absence of the tail, and has by many naturalists, been held to
  form a distinct genus, <i>Inuus</i>, confined to the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>Of bats there are one or two genera (<i>Barbastellus</i>, <i>Plecotus</i>) which seem to be
  mainly or wholly Palæarctic, but the classification of these animals is in such an unsettled state
  that the distribution of the genera is of little importance.</p>

  <p>In the next order, Insectivora, we have almost the entire family of the Moles confined to the
  region. <i>Talpa</i> just enters Northern India; and <i>Urotrichus</i> is common to Japan and
  <span class="pagenum" id="page182">{182}</span>North-Western America, but the remaining genera,
  six in number, are all exclusively Palæarctic.</p>

  <p>Among Carnivora we have <i>Nyctereutes</i>, the curious racoon-dog of Japan and North-Eastern
  Asia; <i>Lutronectes</i>, an otter peculiar to Japan; and the badger (<i>Meles</i>), which ranges
  over the whole region, and just enters the Oriental region as far as Hongkong; <i>Æluropus</i>, a
  curious form of the Himalayan panda, inhabiting the high mountains of Eastern Thibet; and
  <i>Pelagius</i>, a genus of seals, ranging from the shores of Madeira to the Black Sea.</p>

  <p>The Ungulata, or hoofed animals, are still more productive of forms peculiar to this region.
  First we have the Camels, whose native home is the desert region of Central and Western Asia and
  Northern Africa, and which, even in their domesticated condition, are confined almost wholly
  within the limits of the Palæarctic region. Of Deer we have six peculiar genera, <i>Dama</i> and
  <i>Capreolus</i> found in Europe, with <i>Elaphodus</i>, <i>Lophotragus</i>, <i>Hydropotes</i>,
  and <i>Moschus</i>, confined to Northern China and Mongolia. The great family
  Bovidæ&mdash;comprising the oxen, sheep, goats and antelopes&mdash;furnishes no less than seven
  peculiar Palæarctic genera. These are <i>Poephagus</i>, the yak of Thibet; <i>Addax</i>, a
  well-known antelope of Northern Africa and Syria; <i>Procapra</i>, <i>Pantholops</i> and
  <i>Budorcas</i>, antelopine genera peculiar to Thibet and Mongolia; with <i>Rupicapra</i> (the
  chamois), and the extraordinary large-nosed antelope <i>Saiga</i>, confined to Europe and Western
  Asia. Besides these we have <i>Capra</i> (the wild sheep and goats), all the numerous species of
  which, except two, are exclusively Palæarctic.</p>

  <p>Coming to the Rodents, we have again many peculiar forms. Of Muridæ (the mouse and rat tribe),
  we have six peculiar genera, the more important being <i>Cricetus</i>, <i>Rhombomys Sminthus</i>,
  and <i>Myospalax</i>. Of Spalacidæ (mole-rats) both the Palæarctic genera, <i>Ellobius</i> and
  <i>Spalax</i>, are peculiar. <i>Ctenodactylus</i>, a genus of the South American family
  Octodontidæ, is found only in North Africa. To these we may add <i>Myoxus</i> (the dormice) and
  <i>Lagomys</i> (the pikas or tail-less hares) as essentially Palæarctic, since but one species of
  each genus is found beyond the limits of the region.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;It appears to have been the opinion of many <span class="pagenum"
  id="page183">{183}</span>naturalists that the Palæarctic region could not be well characterised by
  its peculiar genera of birds. In Mr. Sclater's celebrated paper already referred to, he remarks,
  "It cannot be denied that the ornithology of the Palæarctic region is more easily characterised by
  what it has not than by what it has," and this has been quite recently quoted by Mr. Allen, in his
  essay on the distribution of North American birds, as if it represented our present knowledge of
  the subject. But, thanks to the labours of Dr. Jerdon, Mr. Swinhoe, Père David and others, we have
  now learnt that a large number of birds included in the Indian list, are either mere winter
  emigrants from Central Asia, or only inhabit the higher ranges of the Himalayas, and thus really
  belong to the Palæarctic region. The result is, that a host of genera are now seen to be either
  exclusively or characteristically Palæarctic, and we have no further difficulty in giving positive
  ornithological characters to the region. In the tables appended to this chapter, all these truly
  Palæarctic genera will be found printed in <i>italics</i>, with an indication of their
  distribution, which will sometimes be found more fully given under the respective families in the
  <span class="correction" title="&quot;third&quot; in printed work, corrected by
  Errata">fourth</span> part of this work. Referring to this table for details we shall here
  summarise the results.</p>

  <p>Of the Sylviidæ or warblers, no less than fourteen genera are either exclusively or
  characteristically Palæarctic, of which <i>Locustella</i>, <i>Sylvia</i>, <i>Curruca</i> and
  <i>Erithacus</i> are good examples. Of the oriental family Timaliidæ, the genus <i>Pterorhinus</i>
  is Palæarctic. Of Panuridæ, or reedlings, there are four peculiar genera (comprising almost the
  whole family); of Certhiidæ, or creepers, one&mdash;<i>Tichodroma</i>&mdash;which extends
  southward to the Abyssinian highlands. Of Paridæ, or tits, one&mdash;<i>Acredula</i>; of Corvidæ,
  or crows, four&mdash;<i>Pica</i> (containing our magpie) being a good example; of Fringillidæ, or
  finches and buntings, twelve, among which <i>Acanthis</i>, <i>Pyrrhula</i> and <i>Emberiza</i> are
  good illustrations; of Alaudidæ, or larks, there are two peculiar genera. Leaving the Passeres we
  next come to peculiar forms among the gallinaceous birds: <i>Syrrhaptes</i> among the Pteroclidæ
  or sand grouse; four genera of Tetraonidæ or grouse and partridges, and five of Phasianidæ or
  pheasants, comprising some of the most magnificent birds in the world. Lastly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page184">{184}</span>among the far-wandering aquatic birds we have no less
  than five genera which are more especially Palæarctic,&mdash;<i>Ortygometra</i>, the corn-crake,
  and <i>Otis</i>, the great bustard, being typical examples. We may add to these, several genera
  almost confined to this region, such as <i>Garrulus</i> (jays), <i>Fringilla</i> (true finches),
  <i>Yunx</i> (wrynecks) and some others; so that in proportion to its total generic forms a very
  large number are found to be peculiar or characteristic.</p>

  <p>This view, of the high degree of speciality of the Palæarctic region, will no doubt be objected
  to by some naturalists, on the ground that many of the genera reckoned as exclusively Palæarctic
  are not so, but extend more or less into other regions. It is well, therefore, to consider what
  principles should guide us in a matter of this kind, especially as we shall have to apply the same
  rules to each of the other regions. We may remark first, that the limits of the regions themselves
  are, when not formed by the ocean, somewhat arbitrary, depending on the average distribution of a
  number of characteristic forms; and that slight local peculiarities of soil, elevation, or
  climate, may cause the species of one region to penetrate more or less deeply into another. The
  land boundary between two regions will be, not a defined line but a neutral territory of greater
  or less width, within which the forms of both regions will intermingle; and this neutral territory
  itself will merge imperceptibly into both regions. So long therefore as a species or genus does
  not permanently reside considerably beyond the possible limits of this neutral territory, we
  should not claim it as an inhabitant of the adjacent region. A consideration of perhaps more
  importance arises, from the varying extent of the range of a genus, over the area occupied by the
  region. Some genera are represented by single species existing only in a very limited area; others
  by numerous species which occupy, entirely or very nearly, the whole extent of the region; and
  there is every intermediate grade between these extremes. Now, the small localised genera, are
  always reckoned as among the best examples of types peculiar to a region; while the more
  wide-spread groups are often denied that character if they extend a little beyond <span
  class="pagenum" id="page185">{185}</span>the supposed regional limits, or send one or two, out of
  a large number of species, into adjacent regions; yet there is some reason to believe that the
  latter are really more important as characterising a zoological region than the former. In the
  case of a single isolated species or genus we have a dying-out group; and we have so many cases of
  discontinuous species of such groups (of which <i>Urotrichus</i> in Japan and British Columbia,
  <i>Eupetes</i> in Sumatra and New Guinea are examples), that it is quite as probable as not, that
  any such isolated species has only become peculiar to the region by the recent extinction of an
  allied form or forms in some other region. On the other hand, a genus consisting of numerous
  species ranging over an entire region or the greater part of one, is a dominant group, which has
  most likely been for some time extending its range, and whose origin dates back to a remote
  period. The slight extension of such a group beyond the limits of the region to which it mainly
  belongs, is probably a recent phenomenon, and in that case cannot be held in any degree to detract
  from its value as one of the peculiar forms of that region.</p>

  <p>The most numerous examples of this class, are those birds of the temperate regions which in
  winter migrate, either wholly or partially, into adjacent warmer countries. This migration most
  likely began subsequent to the Miocene period, during that gradual refrigeration of the temperate
  zones which culminated in the glacial epoch, and which still continues in a mitigated form. Most
  of the genera, and many even of the species of birds which migrate southwards in winter, have
  therefore, most likely, always been inhabitants of our present Palæarctic and Nearctic regions;
  permanent residents during warm epochs, but only able now to maintain their existence by migration
  in winter. Such groups belong truly to the temperate zones, and the test of this is the fact of
  their not having any, or very few, representatives, which are permanent residents in the adjacent
  tropical regions. When there are such representative species, we do not claim them as peculiar to
  the Northern regions. Bearing in mind these various considerations, it will be found that we have
  been very moderate in our estimate of the number of genera <span class="pagenum"
  id="page186">{186}</span>that may fairly be considered as exclusively or characteristically
  Palæarctic.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;The Palæarctic region possesses, in proportion to its
  limited reptilian fauna, a full proportion of peculiar types. We have for instance two genera of
  snakes, <i>Rhinechis</i> and <i>Halys</i>; seven of lizards, <i>Trigonophis</i>,
  <i>Psammodromus</i>, <i>Hyalosaurus</i>, <i>Scincus</i>, <i>Ophiomorus</i>, <i>Megalochilus</i>,
  and <i>Phrynocephalus</i>; eight of tailed batrachians, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Salamandra</i>,
  <i>Seiranota</i>, <i>Chioglossa</i>, <i>Hynobius</i>, <i>Onychodactylus</i>, <i>Geotriton</i>, and
  <i>Sieboldia</i>; and eight of tail-less batrachians, <i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Pelobates</i>,
  <i>Didocus</i>, <i>Alytes</i>, <i>Pelodytes</i>, <i>Discoglossus</i>, <i>Laprissa</i>, and
  <i>Latonia</i>. The distribution of these and other Palæarctic genera will be found in our second
  vol. chap. xix.</p>

  <p><i>Freshwater Fish.</i>&mdash;About twenty genera of freshwater fishes are wholly confined to
  this region, and constitute a feature which ought not to be overlooked in estimating its claim to
  the rank of a separate primary division of the earth. They belong to the following
  families:&mdash;Percidæ (three genera), <i>Acerina</i>, <i>Percarina</i>, <i>Aspro</i>;
  Comephoridæ (one genus), <i>Comephorus</i>, found only in Lake Baikal; Salmonidæ (three genera),
  <i>Brachymystax</i>, <i>Luciotrutta</i>, and <i>Plecoglossus</i>; Cyprinodontidæ (one genus),
  <i>Tellia</i>, found only in Alpine pools on the Atlas Mountains; Cyprinidæ (thirteen genera),
  <i>Cyprinus</i>, <i>Carassus</i>, <i>Paraphoxinus</i>, <i>Tinca</i>, <i>Achilognathus</i>,
  <i>Rhodeus</i>, <i>Chondrostoma</i>, <i>Pseudoperilampus</i>, <i>Ochetebius</i>, <i>Aspius</i>,
  <i>Alburnus</i>, <i>Misgurnus</i>, and <i>Nemachilus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of Palæarctic Vertebrata.</i>&mdash;Summarising these details, we find that the
  Palæarctic region possesses thirty-five peculiar genera of mammalia, fifty-seven of birds, nine of
  reptiles, sixteen of amphibia, and twenty-one of freshwater fishes; or a total of 138 peculiar
  generic types of vertebrata. Of these, 87 are mammalia and land-birds out of a total of 274 genera
  of these groups; or rather less than one-third peculiar, a number which will serve usefully to
  compare with the results obtained in other regions.</p>

  <p>In our chapter on Zoological Regions we have already pointed out the main features which
  distinguish the Palæarctic from the Oriental and Ethiopian regions. The details now given will
  <span class="pagenum" id="page187">{187}</span>strengthen our view of their radical distinctness,
  by showing to how considerable an extent the former is inhabited by peculiar, and often very
  remarkable generic types.</p>

  <p><i>Insects: Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;The Diurnal Lepidoptera, or butterflies, are not very
  abundant in species, their number being probably somewhat over 500, and these belong to not more
  than fifty genera. But no less than fifteen of these genera are wholly confined to the region.
  Nine of the families are represented, as follows:&mdash;1. <i>Danaidæ</i>; having only a single
  species in South Europe. 2. <i>Satyridæ</i>; well represented, there being more than 100 species
  in Europe, and three peculiar genera. 3. <i>Nymphalidæ</i>; rather poorly represented, Europe
  having only about sixty species, but there is one peculiar genus. 4. <i>Libytheidæ</i>; a very
  small family, represented by a single species occurring in South Europe. 5. <i>Nemeobiidæ</i>; a
  rather small family, also having only one species in Europe, but which constitutes a peculiar
  genera. 6. <i>Lycænidæ</i>; an extensive family, fairly represented, having about eighty European
  species; there are two peculiar genera in the Palæarctic region. 7. <i>Pieridæ</i>; rather poorly
  represented with thirty-two European species; two of the genera are, however, peculiar. 8.
  <i>Papilionidæ</i>; very poorly represented in Europe with only twelve species, but there are many
  more in Siberia and Japan. No less than five of the small number of genera in this family are
  wholly confined to the region, a fact of much importance, and which to a great extent redeems the
  character of the Palæarctic region as regard this order of insects. Their names are
  <i>Mesapia</i>, <i>Hypermnestra</i>, <i>Doritis</i>, <i>Sericinus</i>, and <i>Thais</i>; and
  besides these we have <i>Parnassius</i>&mdash;the "Apollo" butterflies&mdash;highly
  characteristic, and only found elsewhere in the mountains of the Nearctic region. 9.
  <i>Hesperidæ</i>; poorly represented with about thirty European species, and one peculiar
  genus.</p>

  <p>Four families of <i>Sphingina</i> occur in the Palæarctic region, and there are several
  peculiar genera.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Zygænidæ</i> there are two exclusively European genera, and the extensive genus
  <i>Zygæna</i> is itself mainly Palæarctic. The small family <i>Stygiidæ</i> has two out of its
  three genera <span class="pagenum" id="page188">{188}</span>confined to the Palæarctic region. In
  the <i>Ægeriidæ</i> the genus <i>Ægeria</i> is mainly Palæarctic. The <i>Sphingidæ</i> have a
  wider general range, and none of the larger genera are peculiar to any one region.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The Palæarctic region is the richest portion of the globe in the great
  family of <i>Carabidæ</i>, or predacious ground-beetles, about 50 of the genera being confined to
  it, while many others, including the magnificent genus <i>Carabus</i>, have here their highest
  development. While several of the smaller genera are confined to the eastern or western
  sub-regions, most of the larger ones extend over the whole area, and give it an unmistakable
  aspect; while in passing from east to west or <i>vice-versâ</i>, allied species and genera replace
  each other with considerable regularity, except in the extreme south-east, where, in China and
  Japan, some Oriental forms appear, as do a few Ethiopian types in the south-west.</p>

  <p>Cicindelidæ, or tiger-beetles, are but poorly represented by about 70 species of the genus
  <i>Cicindela</i>, and a single <i>Tetracha</i> in South Europe.</p>

  <p>Lucanidæ, or stag-beetles, are also poor, there being representatives of 8 genera. One of
  these, <i>Æsalus</i> (a single species), is peculiar to South Europe, and two others,
  <i>Cladognathus</i> and <i>Cyclopthalmus</i>, are only represented in Japan, China, and
  Thibet.</p>

  <p>Cetoniidæ, or rose-chafers, are represented by 13 genera, two of which are peculiar to South
  Europe (<i>Tropinota</i> and <i>Heterocnemis</i>), while <i>Stalagmosoma</i>, ranging from Persia
  to Nubia, and the fine <i>Dicranocephalus</i> inhabiting North China, Corea, and Nipal, may also
  be considered to belong to it. The genera <i>Trichius</i>, <i>Gnorimus</i>, and <i>Osmoderma</i>
  are confined to the two north temperate regions.</p>

  <p>Buprestidæ, or metallic beetles, are rather abundant in the warmer parts of the region, 27
  genera being represented, nine of which are peculiar. By far the larger portion of these are
  confined to the Mediterranean sub-region. A considerable number also inhabit Japan and China.</p>

  <p>The Longicorns, or long-horned beetles, are represented by no less than 196 genera, 51 of which
  are peculiar. They are <span class="pagenum" id="page189">{189}</span>much more abundant in the
  southern than the northern half of the region. Several Oriental genera extend to Japan and North
  China, and a few Ethiopian genera to North Africa. Thirteen genera are confined, to the two north
  temperate regions. Several large genera, such as <i>Dorcadion</i> (154 species), <i>Phytæcia</i>
  (85 species), <i>Pogonochærus</i> (22 species), <i>Agapanthia</i> (22 species), and
  <i>Vesperus</i> (7 species), are altogether peculiar to the Palæarctic region; and with a
  preponderance of <i>Leptura</i>, <i>Grammoptera</i>, <i>Stenocorus</i>, and several others,
  strongly characterise it as distinct from the Nearctic and Oriental regions.</p>

  <p>The other families which are well developed in the Palæarctic regions, are, the Staphylinidæ or
  rove-beetles, Silphidæ or burying-beetles, Histeridæ or mimic-beetles, Nitidulidæ, Aphodiidæ,
  Copridæ (especially in South Europe), Geotrupidæ or dung-beetles, Melolonthidæ or chafers,
  Elateridæ or click-beetles, the various families of Malacoderms and Heteromera, especially
  Pimeliidæ in the Mediterranean sub-region, Curculionidæ or weevils, the Phytophaga or leaf-eaters,
  and Cocinellidæ or lady-birds.</p>

  <p>The number of species of Coleoptera in the western part of the Palæarctic region is about
  15,000, and there are probably not more than 2,000 to add to this number from Siberia, Japan, and
  North China; but were these countries as well explored as Europe, we may expect that they would
  add at least 5,000 to the number above given, raising the Palæarctic Coleopterous fauna to 20,000
  species. As the total number of species at present known to exist in collections is estimated (and
  perhaps somewhat over-estimated) at 70,000 species, we may be sure that were the whole earth as
  thoroughly investigated as Europe, the number would be at least doubled, since we cannot suppose
  that Europe, with the Mediterranean basin, can contain more than one-fifth of the whole of the
  Coleoptera of the globe.</p>

  <p>Of the other orders of insects we here say nothing, because in their case much more than in
  that of the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, is the disproportion enormous between our knowledge of the
  European fauna and that of almost all the rest of the globe. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page190">{190}</span>They are, therefore, at present of comparatively little use for purposes
  of geographical distribution, even were it advisable to enter into the subject in a work which
  will, perhaps, be too much overburdened with details only of interest to specialists.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Land Shells.</i>&mdash;These are very numerous in the warmer parts of the
  region, but comparatively scarce towards the North. South Europe alone possesses over 600 species,
  whereas there are only 200 in all Northern Europe and Asia. The total number of species in the
  whole region is probably about 1,250, of which the great majority are Helicidæ; the Operculated
  families being very poorly represented. Several small genera or sub-genera are peculiar to the
  region, as <i>Testacella</i> (West Europe and Canaries); <i>Leucochroa</i> (Mediterranean
  district); <i>Acicula</i> (Europe); <i>Craspedopoma</i> (Atlantic Islands); <i>Leonia</i> (Algeria
  and Spain); <i>Pomatias</i> (Europe and Canaries); <i>Cecina</i> (Mongolia). The largest genera
  are <i>Helix</i> and <i>Clausilia</i>, which together comprise more than half the species;
  <i>Pupa</i>, very numerous; <i>Bulimus</i> and <i>Achatina</i> in moderate numbers, and all the
  rest small. <i>Helix</i> is the only genus which contains large and handsome species;
  <i>Bulimus</i> and <i>Achatina</i>, so magnificent in tropical countries, being here represented
  by small and obscure forms only. <i>Daudebardia</i> is confined to Central and South Europe and
  New Zealand; <i>Glandina</i> is chiefly South American; <i>Hyalina</i> is only American and
  European; <i>Buliminus</i> ranges over all the world except America; and the other European genera
  of Helicidæ are widely distributed. Of the Operculata, <i>Cyclotus</i>, <i>Cyclophorus</i>, and
  <i>Pupina</i> extend from the Oriental region into Japan and North China; <i>Tudoria</i> is found
  in Algeria and the West Indies; <i>Hydrocena</i> is widely scattered, and occurs in South Europe
  and Japan. The genera of freshwater shells are all widely distributed.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Palæarctic Sub-regions.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The four sub-regions which are here adopted, have been fixed upon as those which
  are, in the present state of our knowledge, at once the most natural and the only practicable
  ones. <span class="pagenum" id="page191">{191}</span>No doubt all of them could be advantageously
  again subdivided, in a detailed study of the geographical distribution of <i>species</i>. But in a
  general work, which aims at treating all parts of the world with equal fulness, and which
  therefore is confined almost wholly to the distribution of families and genera, such further
  subdivision would be out of place. It is even difficult, in some of the classes of animals, to
  find peculiar or even characteristic genera for the present sub-regions; but they all have well
  marked climatic and physical differences, and this leads to an assemblage of species and of groups
  which are sufficiently distinctive.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>I. Central and Northern Europe.</i></p>

  <p>This sub-region, which may perhaps be termed the "European," is zoologically and botanically
  the best known on the globe. It can be pretty accurately defined, as bounded on the south by the
  Pyrenees, the Alps, the Balkans, the Black Sea, and the Caucasus range; and by the Ural Mountains,
  or perhaps more correctly the valley of the Irtish and Caspian Sea, on the east; while Ireland and
  Iceland are its furthest outliers in the west. To the north, it merges so gradually into the
  Arctic zone that no demarcation is possible. The great extent to which this sub-region is
  interpenetrated by the sea, and the prevalence of westerly winds bringing warmth and moisture from
  an ocean influenced by the gulf-stream, give it a climate for the most part genial, and free from
  extremes of heat and cold. It is thus broadly distinguished from Siberia and Northern Asia
  generally, where a more extreme and rigorous climate prevails.</p>

  <p>The whole of this sub-region is well watered, being penetrated by rivers in every direction;
  and it consists mainly of plains and undulating country of moderate elevation, the chief mountain
  ranges being those of Scandinavia in the north-west, and the extensive alpine system of Central
  Europe. But these are both of moderate height, and a very small portion of their surface is
  occupied either by permanent snow-fields, or by barren uplands inimical to vegetable and animal
  life. It is, in <span class="pagenum" id="page192">{192}</span>fact, to these, and the numerous
  lesser mountains and hills which everywhere diversify the surface of Europe, that the variety and
  abundance of its animal life is greatly due. They afford the perennial supplies to rivers, and
  furnish in their valleys and ever varying slopes, stations suited to every form of existence. A
  considerable area of Central Europe is occupied by uplands of moderate elevation, a comparatively
  small portion being flat and marshy plains.</p>

  <p>Most of the northern and much of the central portions of Europe are covered with vast forests
  of coniferous trees; and these, occupying as they do those tracts where the winter is most severe,
  supply food and shelter to many animals who could not otherwise maintain their existence. It is
  probable that the original condition of the greater part, if not the whole, of temperate Europe,
  except the flat marshes of the river valleys and the sandy downs of the coast, was that of
  woodland and forest, mostly of deciduous trees, but with a plentiful admixture of such hardy
  evergreens as holly, ivy, privet, and yew. A sufficient proportion of these primeval woods, and of
  artificial plantations which have replaced them, fortunately remain, to preserve for us most of
  the interesting forms of life, which were developed before man had so greatly modified the surface
  of the earth, and so nearly exterminated many of its original tenants. Almost exactly in
  proportion to the amount of woodland that still remains in any part of Europe, do we find (other
  things being equal) the abundance and variety of wild animals; a pretty clear indication that the
  original condition of the country was essentially that of a forest, a condition which only now
  exists in the thinly inhabited regions of the north.</p>

  <p>Although the sub-region we are considering is, for its extent and latitude, richly peopled with
  animal life, the number of genera altogether peculiar to it is not great. There are, however,
  several which are very characteristic, and many species, both of the smaller mammalia and of
  birds, are wholly restricted to it.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The genera wholly confined to this sub-region are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page193">{193}</span>only two. <i>Myogale</i>, the desman, is a curious long-snouted
  Insectivorous animal somewhat resembling the water-rat in its habits. There are two species, one
  found only on the banks of streams in the French Pyrenees, the other on the great rivers of
  Southern Russia. The other peculiar genus, <i>Rupicapra</i> (the chamois of the Alps), is found on
  all the high mountains of Central Europe. Almost peculiar are <i>Spalax</i> (the mole-rat) found
  only in Eastern Europe and Western Siberia; and <i>Saiga</i>, an extraordinary large-nosed
  antelope which has a nearly similar distribution. Highly characteristic forms, which inhabit
  nearly every part of the sub-region, are, <i>Talpa</i> (the mole), <i>Erinaceus</i>, (the
  hedgehog), <i>Sorex</i> (the shrew), <i>Meles</i> (the badger), <i>Ursus</i> (the bear),
  <i>Canis</i> (the wolf and fox), <i>Mustela</i> (the weasel), <i>Lutra</i> (the otter),
  <i>Arvicola</i> (the vole), <i>Myoxus</i> (the dormouse), and <i>Lepus</i> (the hare and rabbit);
  while <i>Bos</i> (the wild bull) was, until exterminated by man, no doubt equally characteristic.
  Other genera inhabiting the sub-region will be found in the list given at the end of this
  chapter.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;It is difficult to name the birds that are most characteristic of this
  sub-region, because so many of the most familiar and abundant are emigrants from the south, and
  belong to groups that have a different range. There is perhaps not a single genus wholly confined
  to it, and very few that have not equal claims to be placed elsewhere. Among the more
  characteristic we may name <i>Turdus</i> (the thrushes), <i>Sylvia</i> (the warblers),
  <i>Panurus</i> (the reedling), <i>Parus</i> (the tits), <i>Anthus</i> (the pipits),
  <i>Motacilla</i> (the wagtails), which are perhaps more abundant here than in any other part of
  the world, <i>Emberiza</i> (the buntings), <i>Plectrophanes</i> (the snow buntings), <i>Passer</i>
  (the house sparrows), <i>Loxia</i> (the crossbills), <i>Linota</i> (the linnets), <i>Pica</i> (the
  magpies), <i>Tetrao</i> (grouse), <i>Lagopus</i> (ptarmigan) and many others.</p>

  <p>I am indebted to Mr. H. E. Dresser, who is personally acquainted with the ornithology of much
  of the North of Europe, for some valuable notes on the northern range of many European birds.
  Those which are characteristic of the extreme Arctic zone, extending beyond 70° north latitude,
  and tolerably abundant, are two falcons (<i>Falco gyrfalco</i> and <i>F. peregrinus</i>); <span
  class="pagenum" id="page194">{194}</span>the rough-legged buzzard (<i>Archibuteo lagopus</i>); the
  snowy owl (<i>Nyctea scandiaca</i>); the raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>); three buntings (<i>Emberiza
  schæniculus</i>, <i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i> and <i>P. calcarata</i>); a lark (<i>Otocorys
  alpestris</i>); several pipits, the most northern being <i>Anthus cervinus</i>; a wagtail
  (<i>Budytes cinereocapilla</i>); a dipper (<i>Cinclus melanogaster</i>); a warbler (<i>Cyanecula
  suecica</i>); the wheatear (<i>Saxicola &#x0153;nanthe</i>); and two ptarmigans (<i>Lagopus
  albus</i> and <i>L. salicetus</i>). Most of these birds are, of course, only summer visitors to
  the Arctic regions, the only species noted as a permanent resident in East Finmark (north of
  latitude 70°) being the snow-bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>).</p>

  <p>The birds that are characteristic of the zone of pine forests, or from about 61° to 70° north
  latitude, are very numerous, and it will be sufficient to note the genera and the number of
  species (where more than one) to give an idea of the ornithology of this part of Europe. The birds
  of prey are, <i>Falco</i> (three species), <i>Astur</i> (two species), <i>Buteo</i>,
  <i>Pandion</i>, <i>Surnia</i>, <i>Bubo</i>, <i>Syrnium</i>, <i>Asio</i>, <i>Nyctala</i>. The chief
  Passerine birds are, <i>Corvus</i> (two species), <i>Pica</i>, <i>Garrulus</i> (two species),
  <i>Nucifraga</i>, <i>Bombycilla</i>, <i>Hirundo</i> (two species), <i>Muscicapa</i> (two species),
  <i>Lanius</i>, <i>Sturnus</i>, <i>Passer</i> (two species), <i>Pyrrhula</i>, <i>Carpodacus</i>,
  <i>Loxia</i> (two species), <i>Pinicola</i>, <i>Fringilla</i> (eight species), <i>Emberiza</i>
  (five species), <i>Alauda</i>, <i>Anthus</i>, <i>Turdus</i> (five species), <i>Ruticilla</i>,
  <i>Pratincola</i>, <i>Accentor</i>, <i>Sylvia</i> (four species), <i>Hypolais</i>, <i>Regulus</i>,
  <i>Phylloscopus</i> (two species), <i>Acrocephalus</i>, <i>Troglodytes</i>, and <i>Parus</i> (six
  species). Woodpeckers are abundant, <i>Picus</i> (four species), <i>Gecinus</i>, and <i>Yunx</i>.
  The kingfisher (<i>Alcedo</i>), goatsucker (<i>Caprimulgus</i>), and swift (<i>Cypselus</i>) are
  also common. The wood-pigeon (<i>Columba</i>) is plentiful. The gallinaceous birds are three
  grouse, <i>Tetrao</i> (two species) and <i>Bonasa</i>, and the common quail (<i>Coturnix</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp5">The remaining genera and species of temperate or north-European birds, do not
  usually range beyond the region of deciduous trees, roughly indicated by the parallel of 60° north
  latitude.</p>

  <p><i>Plate I.&mdash;Illustrating the Zoology of Central Europe.</i>&mdash;Before considering the
  distribution of the other classes of vertebrata, it will be convenient to introduce our first
  illustration, which represents a scene in the Alps of Central Europe, with figures of some of the
  most characteristic Mammalia and Birds of this sub-region. On the left is the badger (<i>Meles
  Taxus</i>) one of the weasel family, and belonging to a genus which is strictly Palæarctic. It
  abounds in Central and Northern Europe and also extends into North Asia, but is represented by
  another species in Thibet and by a third in Japan. The elegantly-formed creatures on the right are
  chamois (<i>Rupicapra tragus</i>), almost the only European antelopes, and wholly confined to the
  higher mountains, from the Pyrenees to the Carpathians and the Caucasus. The chamois is the only
  species of the genus, and is thus perhaps the most characteristic European mammal. The bird on the
  left, above the badgers, is the Alpine chough, (<i>Fregilus pyrrhocorax</i>). It is found in the
  high mountains from the Alps to the Himalayas, and is allied to the Cornish chough, which is still
  found on our south-western coasts, and which ranges to Abyssinia and North China. The Alpine
  chough differs in having a shorter bill of an orange colour, and vermilion red feet as in the
  other species. In the foreground are a pair of ruffs (<i>Machetes pugnax</i>) belonging to the
  Scolopacidæ or snipe family, and most nearly allied to the genus <i>Tringa</i> or sandpiper. This
  bird is remarkable for the fine collar of plumes which adorns the males in the breeding season,
  when they are excessively pugnacious. It is the only species of its genus, and ranges over all
  Europe and much of Northern Asia, migrating in the winter to the plains of India, and even down
  the east coast of Africa as far as the Cape of Good Hope; but it only breeds in the Palæarctic
  region, over the greater part of which it ranges.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;There are no genera of reptiles peculiar to this
  sub-region. Both snakes and lizards are comparatively scarce, there being about fourteen species
  of the former and twelve of the latter. Our common snake (<i>Tropidonotus natrix</i>) extends into
  Sweden and North Russia, but the viper (<i>Viperus berus</i>) goes further north, as far as
  Archangel (64° N.), and in Scandinavia (67° N.), and is the most Arctic of all known <span
  class="pagenum" id="page196">{196}</span>snakes. Of the lizards, <i>Lacerta stirpium</i> (the sand
  lizard) has the most northerly range, extending into Poland and Northern Russia; and <i>Anguis
  fragilis</i> (the blind or slow-worm) has almost an equal range.</p>

  <p>Amphibia, being more adapted to a northern climate, have acquired a more special development,
  and thus several forms are peculiar to the North European sub-region. Most remarkable is
  <i>Proteus</i>, a singular eel-like aquatic creature with small legs, found only in the
  subterranean lakes in Carniola and Carinthia; <i>Alytes</i>, a curious toad, the male of which
  carries about the eggs till they are hatched, found only in Central Europe from France to the east
  of Hungary; and <i>Pelodytes</i>, a frog found only in France. Frogs and toads are very abundant
  all over Europe, the common frog (<i>Rana temporaria</i>) extending to the extreme north. The
  newts (<i>Triton</i>) are also very abundant and widely spread, though not ranging so far north as
  the frogs. The genera <i>Bombinator</i> (a toad-like frog), and <i>Hyla</i> (the tree frog) are
  also common in Central Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Freshwater Fish.</i>&mdash;Two genera of the perch family (Percidæ) are peculiar to this
  sub-region,&mdash;<i>Percarina</i>, a fish found only in the river Dniester, and <i>Aspro</i>,
  confined to the rivers of Central Europe. Of the very characteristic forms are,
  <i>Gasterosteus</i> (stickle-back), which alone forms a peculiar family&mdash;Gasterosteidæ;
  <i>Perca</i>, <i>Acerina</i> and <i>Lucioperca</i>, genera of the perch family; <i>Silurus</i>, a
  large fish found in the rivers of Cenrtal Europe, of the family Siluridæ; <i>Esox</i> (the pike),
  of the family Esocidæ; <i>Cyprinus</i> (carp), <i>Gobio</i> (gudgeon), <i>Leuciscus</i> (roach,
  chub, dace, &amp;c.), <i>Tinca</i> (tench), <i>Abramus</i> (bream), <i>Alburnus</i> (bleak),
  <i>Cobitis</i> (loach), all genera of the family Cyprinidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Insects&mdash;Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;No genera of butterflies are actually confined to this
  sub-region, but many are characteristic of it. <i>Parnassius</i>, <i>Aporia</i>,
  <i>Leucophasia</i>, <i>Colias</i>, <i>Melitæa</i>, <i>Argynnis</i>, <i>Vanessa</i>,
  <i>Limenitis</i>, and <i>Chionobas</i>, are all very abundant and widespread, and give a feature
  to the entomology of most of the countries included in it.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;This sub-region is very rich in Carabidæ; the genera <i>Elaphrus</i>,
  <i>Nebria</i>, <i>Carabus</i>, <i>Cychrus</i>, <i>Pterostichus</i>, <i>Amara</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page197">{197}</span><i>Trechus</i> and <i>Peryphus</i> being especially
  characteristic. Staphylinidæ abound. Among Lamellicorns the genus <i>Aphodius</i> is most
  characteristic. Buprestidæ are scarce; Elateridæ more abundant. Among Malacoderms
  <i>Telephorus</i> and <i>Malachius</i> are characteristic. Curculionidæ abound:
  <i>Otiorhyuchus</i>, <i>Omias</i>, <i>Erirhinus</i>, <i>Bagous</i>, <i>Rhynchites</i> and
  <i>Ceutorhynchus</i> being very characteristic genera. Of Longicorns <i>Callidium</i>,
  <i>Dorcadion</i>, <i>Pogonochærus</i>, <i>Pachyta</i> and <i>Leptura</i> are perhaps the best
  representatives. <i>Donacia</i>, <i>Crioceris</i>, <i>Chrysomela</i>, and <i>Altica</i>, are
  typical Phytophaga; while <i>Coccinella</i> is the best representative of the Securipalpes.</p>

  <p><i>North European Islands.</i>&mdash;The British Islands are known to have been recently
  connected with the Continent, and their animal productions are so uniformly identical with
  continental species as to require no special note. The only general fact of importance is, that
  the number of species in all groups is much less than in continental districts of equal extent,
  and that this number is still farther diminished in Ireland. This may be accounted for by the
  smaller area and less varied surface of the latter island; and it may also be partly due to the
  great extent of low land, so that a very small depression would reduce it to the condition of a
  cluster of small islands capable of supporting a very limited amount of animal life. Yet further,
  if after such a submergence had destroyed much of the higher forms of life in Great Britain and
  Ireland, both were elevated so as to again form part of the Continent, a migration would commence
  by which they would be stocked afresh; but this migration would be a work of time, and it is to be
  expected that many species would never reach Ireland or would find its excessively moist climate
  unsuited to them.</p>

  <p>Some few British species differ slightly from their continental allies, and are considered by
  many naturalists to be distinct. This is the case with the red grouse (<i>Lagopus scoticus</i>)
  among birds; and a few of the smaller Passeres have also been found to vary somewhat from the
  allied forms on the Continent, showing that the comparatively short interval since the glacial
  period, and the slightly different physical conditions dependent on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page198">{198}</span>insularity, have sufficed to commence the work of specific modification.
  There are also a few small land-shells and several insects not yet found elsewhere than in
  Britain; and even one of the smaller Mammalia&mdash;a shrew (<i>Sorex rusticus</i>). These facts
  are all readily explained by the former union of these islands with the Continent, and the
  alternate depressions and elevations which are proved by geological evidence to have occurred, by
  which they have been more than once separated and united again in recent times. For the evidence
  of this elevation and depression, the reader may consult Sir Charles Lyell's <i>Antiquity of
  Man</i>.</p>

  <p>Iceland is the only other island of importance belonging to this sub-region, and it contrasts
  strongly with Great Britain, both in its Arctic climate and oceanic position. It is situated just
  south of the Arctic circle and considerably nearer Greenland than Europe, yet its productions are
  almost wholly European. The only indigenous land mammalia are the Arctic fox (<i>Canis
  lagopus</i>), and the polar bear as an occasional visitant, with a mouse (<i>Mus islandicus</i>),
  said to be of a peculiar species. Four species of seals visit its shores. The birds are more
  interesting. According to Professor Newton, ninety-five species have been observed; but many of
  these are mere stragglers. There are twenty-three land, and seventy-two aquatic birds and waders.
  Four or five are peculiar species, though very closely related to others inhabiting Scandinavia or
  Greenland. Only two or three species are more nearly related to Greenland birds than to those of
  Northern Europe, so that the Palæarctic character of the fauna is unmistakable. The following
  lists, compiled from a paper by Professor Newton, may be interesting as showing more exactly the
  character of Icelandic ornithology.</p>

  <p>1. Peculiar species.&mdash;<i>Troglodytes borealis</i> (closely allied to the common wren,
  found also in the Faroe Islands); <i>Falco islandicus</i> (closely allied to <i>F. gyrfalco</i>);

  <i>Chelidon urbica</i>, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, <i>Falco æsalon</i>, <i>Surnia nyctea</i>, <i>Otus

  <i>Larus luecopterus</i>, <i>Stercorarius</i> (two species), <i>Fratercula artica</i>,
  <i>Colymbus</i> (two species), <i>Podiceps cornutus</i>.</p>

  <p>5. Annual visitant from Greenland.&mdash;<i>Falco candicans</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">6.&mdash;Former resident, now extinct.&mdash;<i>Alca impennis</i> (the great
  auk).</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>II.&mdash;Mediterranean Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This is by far the richest portion of the Palæarctic region, for although of moderate extent
  much of it enjoys a climate in which the rigours of winter are almost unknown. It includes all the
  countries south of the Pyrenees, Alps, Balkans, and Caucasus mountains; all the southern shores of
  the Mediterranean to the Atlas range, and even beyond it to include the extra-tropical portion of
  the Sahara; and in the Nile valley as far as the second cataract. Further east it includes the
  northern half of Arabia and the whole of Persia, as well as Beluchistan, and perhaps Affghanistan
  up to the banks of the Indus. This extensive district is almost wholly a region of mountains and
  elevated plateaus. On the west, Spain is mainly a table-land of more than 2000 feet elevation,
  deeply penetrated by extensive valleys and rising into lofty mountain chains. Italy, Corsica,
  Sardinia, and Sicily, are all very <span class="pagenum" id="page200">{200}</span>mountainous, and
  much of their surface considerably elevated. Further east we have all European Turkey and Greece,
  a mountain region with a comparatively small extent of level plain. In Asia the whole country,
  from Smyrna through Armenia and Persia to the further borders of Affghanistan, is a vast
  mountainous plateau, almost all above 2000, and extensive districts above 5000 feet in elevation.
  The only large tract of low-land is the valley of the Euphrates. There is also some low-land south
  of the Caucasus, and in Syria the valley of the Jordan. In North Africa the valley of the Nile and
  the coast plains of Tripoli and Algiers are almost the only exceptions to the more or less
  mountainous and plateau-like character of the country. Much of this extensive area is now bare and
  arid, and often even of a desert character; a fact no doubt due, in great part, to the destruction
  of aboriginal forests. This loss is rendered permanent by the absence of irrigation, and, it is
  also thought, by the abundance of camels and goats, animals which are exceedingly injurious to
  woody vegetation, and are able to keep down the natural growth of forests. Mr. Marsh (whose
  valuable work <i>Man and Nature</i> gives much information on this subject) believes that even
  large portions of the African and Asiatic deserts would become covered with woods, and the climate
  thereby greatly improved, were they protected from these destructive domestic animals, which are
  probably not indigenous to the country. Spain, in proportion to its extent, is very barren; Italy
  and European Turkey are more woody and luxuriant; but it is perhaps in Asia Minor, on the range of
  the Taurus, along the shores of the Black Sea, and to the south of the Caucasus range, that this
  sub-region attains its maximum of luxuriance in vegetation and in animal life. From the Caspian
  eastward extends a region of arid plains and barren deserts, diversified by a few more fertile
  valleys, in which the characteristic flora and fauna of this portion of the Palæarctic region
  abounds. Further east we come to the forests of the Hindoo Koosh, which probably form the limit of
  the sub-region. Beyond these we enter on the Siberian sub-region to the north, and on the outlying
  portion of the Oriental region on the south.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page201">{201}</span></div>

  <p>In addition to the territories now indicated as forming part of the Mediterranean sub-region,
  we must add the group of Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa which seem to be an extension
  of the Atlas mountains, and the oceanic groups of Madeira and the Azores; the latter about 1,000
  miles from the continent of Europe, yet still unmistakably allied to it both in their vegetable
  and animal productions. The peculiarities of the faunas of these islands will be subsequently
  referred to.</p>

  <p>It seems at first sight very extraordinary, that so large and wide a sea as the Mediterranean
  should not separate distinct faunas, and this is the more remarkable when we find how very deep
  the Mediterranean is, and therefore how ancient we may well suppose it to be. Its eastern portion
  reaches a depth of 2,100 fathoms or 12,600 feet, while its western basin is about 1,600 fathoms or
  9,600 feet in greatest depth, and a considerable area of both basins is more than 1,000 fathoms
  deep. But a further examination shows, that a comparatively shallow sea or submerged bank incloses
  Malta and Sicily, and that on the opposite coast a similar bank stretches out from the coast of
  Tripoli leaving a narrow channel the greatest depth of which is 240 fathoms. Here therefore is a
  broad plateau, which an elevation of about 1,500 feet would convert into a wide extent of land
  connecting Italy with Africa; while the same elevation would also connect Morocco with Spain,
  leaving two extensive lakes to represent what is now the Mediterranean Sea, and affording free
  communication for land animals between Europe and North Africa. That such a state of things
  existed at a comparatively recent period, is almost certain; not only because a considerable
  number of identical <i>species</i> of mammalia inhabit the opposite shores of the Mediterranean,
  but also because numerous remains of three species of elephants have been found in caves in
  Malta,&mdash;now a small rocky island in which it would be impossible for such animals to live
  even if they could reach it. Remains of hippopotami are also found at Gibraltar, and many other
  animals of African types in Greece; all indicating means of communication between South Europe and
  North Africa which no longer exist. (See Chapter VI. pp. 113-115.)</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page202">{202}</span></div>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;There are a few groups of Palæarctic Mammalia that are peculiar to this
  sub-region. Such are, <i>Dama</i>, the fallow deer, which is now found only in South Europe and
  North Africa; <i>Psammomys</i>, a peculiar genus of Muridæ, found only in Egypt and Palestine;
  while <i>Ctenodactylus</i>, a rat-like animal classed in the South American family Octodontidæ,
  inhabits Tripoli. Among characteristic genera not found in other sub-regions, are, <i>Dysopes</i>,
  a bat of the family Noctilionidæ; <i>Macroscelides</i>, the elephant shrew, in North Africa;
  <i>Genetta</i>, the civet, in South Europe; <i>Herpestes</i>, the ichneumon, in North Africa and
  (?) Spain; <i>Hyæna</i>, in South Europe; <i>Gazella</i>, <i>Oryx</i>, <i>Alcephalus</i>, and
  <i>Addax</i>, genera of antelopes in North Africa and Palestine; <i>Hyrax</i>, in Syria; and
  <i>Hystrix</i>, the porcupine, in South Europe. Besides these, the camel and the horse were
  perhaps once indigenous in the eastern parts of the sub-region; and a wild sheep (<i>Ovis
  musmon</i>) still inhabits Sardinia, Corsica, and the mountains of the south-east of Spain. The
  presence of the large feline animals&mdash;such as the lion, the leopard, the serval, and the
  hunting leopard&mdash;in North Africa, together with several other quadrupeds not found in Europe,
  have been thought by some naturalists to prove, that this district should not form part of the
  Palæarctic region. No doubt several Ethiopian groups and species have entered it from the south;
  but the bulk of its Mammalia still remains Palæarctic, although several of the species have
  Asiatic rather than European affinities. The <i>Macacus innuus</i> is allied to an Asiatic rather
  than an African group of monkeys, and thus denotes an Oriental affinity. Ethiopian affinity is
  apparently shown by the three genera of antelopes, by <i>Herpestes</i>, and by
  <i>Macroscelides</i>; but our examination of the Miocene fauna has shown that these were probably
  derived from Europe originally, and do not form any part of the truly indigenous or ancient
  Ethiopian fauna. Against these, however, we have the occurrence in North Africa of such purely
  Palæarctic and non-Ethiopian genera as <i>Ursus</i>, <i>Meles</i>, <i>Putorius</i>, <i>Sus</i>,
  <i>Cervus</i>, <i>Dama</i>, <i>Capra</i>, <i>Alactaga</i>; together with actual European or West
  Asiatic species of <i>Canis</i>, <i>Genetta</i>, <i>Felis</i>, <i>Putorius</i>, <i>Lutra</i>, many
  bats, <i>Sorex</i>, <i>Crocidura</i>, <i>Crossopus</i>, <i>Hystrix</i>, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page203">{203}</span><i>Dipus</i>, <i>Lepus</i>, and <i>Mus</i>. It is admitted that, as
  regards every other group of animals, North Africa is Palæarctic, and the above enumeration shows
  that even in Mammalia, the intermixture of what are now true Ethiopian types is altogether
  insignificant. It must be remembered, also, that the lion inhabited Greece even in historic times,
  while large carnivora were contemporary with man all over Central Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;So many of the European birds migrate over large portions of the region,
  and so many others have a wide permanent range, that we cannot expect to find more than a few
  genera, consisting of one or two species, each, confined to a sub-region; and such appear to be,
  <i>Lusciniola</i> and <i>Pyrophthalma</i>, genera of Sylviidæ. But many are characteristic of
  this, as compared with other Palæarctic sub-regions; such as, <i>Bradyptetus</i>, <i>Aedon</i>,
  <i>Dromol&#x0153;a</i>, and <i>Cercomela</i>, among Sylviidæ; <i>Crateropus</i> and
  <i>Malacocercus</i>, among Timaliidæ; <i>Telophonus</i> among Laniidæ; <i>Certhilauda</i> and
  <i>Mirafra</i> among larks; <i>Pastor</i> among starlings; <i>Upupa</i>, the hoopoe;
  <i>Halycon</i> and <i>Ceryle</i> among kingfishers; <i>Turnix</i> and <i>Caccabis</i> among
  Gallinæ, and the pheasant as an indigenous bird; together with <i>Gyps</i>, <i>Vultur</i> and
  <i>Neophron</i>, genera of vultures. In addition to these, almost all our summer migrants spend
  their winter in some part of this favoured land, mostly in North Africa, together with many
  species of Central Europe that rarely or never visit us. It follows, that a large proportion of
  all the birds of Europe and Western Asia are to be found in this sub-region, as will be seen by
  referring to the list of the genera of the region. Palestine is one of the remote portions of this
  region which has been well explored by Canon Tristram, and it may be interesting to give his
  summary of the range of the birds. We must bear in mind that the great depression of the Dead Sea
  has a tropical climate, which accounts for the presence here only, of such a tropical form as the
  sun-bird (<i>Nectarinea osea</i>).</p>

  <p>The total number of the birds of Palestine is 322, and of these no less than 260 are European,
  at once settling the question of the general affinities of the fauna. Of the remainder eleven
  belong to North and East Asia, four to the Red Sea, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page204">{204}</span>thirty-one to East Africa, while twenty-seven are peculiar to Palestine.
  It is evident therefore that an unusual number of East African birds have extended their range to
  this congenial district, but most of these are desert species and hardly true Ethiopians, and do
  not much interfere with the general Palæarctic character of the whole assemblage. As an
  illustration of how wide-spread are many of the Palæarctic forms, we may add, that seventy-nine
  species of land birds and fifty-five of water birds, are common to Palestine and Britain. The
  Oriental and Ethiopian genera <i>Pycnonotus</i> and <i>Nectarinea</i> are found here, while
  <i>Bessornis</i> and <i>Dromolæa</i> are characteristically Ethiopian. Almost all the other genera
  are Palæarctic.</p>

  <p>Persia is another remote region generally associated with the idea of Oriental and almost
  tropical forms, but which yet undoubtedly belongs to the Palæarctic region. Mr. Blanford's recent
  collections in this country, with other interesting information, is summarised in Mr. Elwes's
  paper on the "Geographical Distribution of Asiatic Birds" (<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i> 1873, p. 647).
  No less than 127 species are found also in Europe, and thirty-seven others belong to European
  genera; seven are allied to birds of Central Asia or Siberia, and fifteen to those of North-East
  Africa, while only three are purely of Indian affinities. This shows a preponderance of nearly
  nine-tenths of Palæarctic forms, which is fully as much as can be expected in any country near the
  limits of a great region.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;The climatal conditions being here more favourable to these
  groups, and the genera being often of limited range, we find some peculiar, and several very
  interesting forms. <i>Rhinechis</i>, a genus of Colubrine snakes, is found only in South Europe;
  <i>Trogonophis</i>, one of the Amphisbænians&mdash;curious snake-like lizards&mdash;is known only
  from North Africa; <i>Psammosaurus</i>, belonging to the water lizards (Varanidæ) is found in
  North Africa and North-West India; <i>Psammodromus</i>, a genus of Lacertidæ, is peculiar to South
  Europe; <i>Hyalosaurus</i>, belonging to the family Zonuridæ, is a lizard of especial interest, as
  it inhabits North Africa while its nearest ally is the <i>Ophisaurus</i> or "glass snake" of North
  America; the family of <span class="pagenum" id="page205">{205}</span>the scinks is represented by
  <i>Scincus</i> found in North Africa and Arabia. Besides these <i>Seps</i>, a genus of sand
  lizards (Sepidæ) and <i>Agama</i>, a genus of Agamidæ, are abundant and characteristic.</p>

  <p>Of Amphibia we have <i>Seiranota</i>, a genus of salamanders found only in Italy and Dalmatia;
  <i>Chioglossa</i>, in Portugal, and <i>Geotriton</i>, in Italy, belonging to the same family, are
  equally peculiar to the sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Freshwater Fish.</i>&mdash;One of the most interesting is <i>Tellia</i>, a genus of
  Cyprinodontidæ found only in alpine pools in the Atlas mountains. <i>Paraphoxinius</i>, found in
  South-East Europe, and <i>Chondrostoma</i>, in Europe and Western Asia, genera of Cyprimidæ, seem
  almost peculiar to this sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Insects&mdash;Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;Two genera of butterflies, <i>Thais</i> and
  <i>Doritis</i>, are wholly confined to this sub-region, the former ranging over all Southern
  Europe, the latter confined to Eastern Europe and Asia Minor. <i>Anthocharis</i> and <i>Zegris</i>
  are very characteristic of it, the latter only extending into South Russia, while <i>Danais</i>,
  <i>Charaxes</i>, and <i>Libythea</i> are tropical genera unknown in other parts of Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;This sub-region is very rich in many groups of Coleoptera, of which a
  few only can be noticed here. Among Carabidæ it possesses <i>Procerus</i> and <i>Procrustes</i>,
  almost exclusively, while <i>Brachinus</i>, <i>Cymindis</i>, <i>Lebia</i>, <i>Graphipterus</i>,
  <i>Scarites</i>, <i>Chlænius</i>, <i>Calathus</i>, and many others, are abundant and
  characteristic. Among Lamellicorns&mdash;Copridæ, Glaphyridæ, Melolonthidæ, and Cetoniidæ abound.
  Buprestidæ are plentiful, the genera <i>Julodis</i>, <i>Acmæodera</i>, <i>Buprestis</i>, and
  <i>Sphenoptera</i> being characteristic. Among Malacoderms&mdash;Cebrionidæ, Lampyridæ, and
  Malachiidæ abound. The Tenebrioid Heteromera are very varied and abundant, and give a character to
  the sub-region. The Mylabridæ, Cantharidæ, and &#x0152;demeridæ are also characteristic. Of the
  immense number of Curculionidæ&mdash;<i>Thylacites</i>, <i>Brachycerus</i>, <i>Lixus</i>, and
  <i>Acalles</i> may be mentioned as among the most prominent. Of Longicorns there are few genera
  especially characteristic, but perhaps <i>Prinobius</i>, <i>Purpuricenus</i>,
  <i>Hesperophanes</i>, and <i>Parmena</i> are most so. Of the remaining families, we may mention
  Clythridæ, Hispidæ, and Cassididæ as being abundant.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page206">{206}</span></div>

  <p><i>The Mediterranean and Atlantic Islands.</i>&mdash;The various islands of the Mediterranean
  are interesting to the student of geographical distribution as affording a few examples of local
  species of very restricted range, but as a rule they present us with exactly the same forms as
  those of the adjacent mainland.<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Their peculiarities
  do not, therefore, properly come within the scope of this work. The islands of the Atlantic Ocean
  belonging to this sub-region are, from their isolated position and the various problems they
  suggest, of much more interest, and their natural history has been carefully studied. We shall
  therefore give a short account of their peculiar features.</p>

  <p>Of the three groups of Atlantic islands belonging to this sub-region, the Canaries are nearest
  to the Continent, some of the islands being only about fifty miles from the coast of Africa. They
  are, however, separated from the mainland by a very deep channel (more than 5,000 feet), as shown
  on our general map. The islands extend over a length of 300 miles; they are very mountainous and
  wholly volcanic, and the celebrated peak of Teneriffe rises to a height of more than 12,000 feet.
  The small Madeira group is about 400 miles from the coast of Morocco and 600 from the southern
  extremity of Portugal; and there is a depth of more than 12,000 feet between it and the continent.
  The Azores are nearly 1,000 miles west of Lisbon. They are quite alone in mid-Atlantic, the most
  westerly islands being nearer Newfoundland than Europe, and are surrounded by ocean depths of from
  12,000 to 18,000 feet. It will be convenient to take these islands first in order.</p>

  <p><i>Azores.</i>&mdash;Considering the remoteness of this group from every other land, it is
  surprising to find as many as fifty-three species of birds inhabiting or visiting the Azores; and
  still more to <span class="pagenum" id="page207">{207}</span>find that they are of Palæarctic
  genera and, with one exception, all of species found either in Europe, North Africa, Madeira, or
  the Canaries. The exception is a bullfinch peculiar to the islands, but closely allied to a
  European species. Of land birds there are twenty-two, belonging to twenty-one genera, all
  European. These genera are <i>Cerchneis</i>, <i>Buteo</i>, <i>Asio</i>, <i>Strix</i>,
  <i>Turdus</i>, <i>Oriolus</i>, <i>Erithacus</i>, <i>Sylvia</i>, <i>Regulus</i>, <i>Saxicola</i>,
  <i>Motacilla</i>, <i>Plectrophanes</i>, <i>Fringilla</i>, <i>Pyrrhula</i>, <i>Serinus</i>,
  <i>Sturnus</i>, <i>Picus</i>, <i>Upupa</i>, <i>Columba</i>, <i>Caccabis</i>, and <i>Coturnix</i>.
  Besides the bullfinch (<i>Pyrrhula</i>) other species show slight differences from their European
  allies, but not such as to render them more than varieties. The only truly indigenous mammal is a
  bat of a European species. Nine butterflies inhabit the Azores; eight of them are European
  species, one North American. Of beetles 212 have been collected, of which no less than 175 are
  European species; of the remainder, nineteen are found in the Canaries or Madeira, three in South
  America, while fourteen are peculiar to the islands.</p>

  <p>Now these facts (for which we are indebted to Mr. Godman's <i>Natural History of the
  Azores</i>) are both unexpected and exceedingly instructive. In most other cases of remote Oceanic
  islands, a much larger proportion of the fauna is endemic, or consists of peculiar species and
  often of peculiar genera; as is well shown by the case of the Galapagos and Juan Fernandez, both
  much nearer to a continent and both containing peculiar genera and species of birds. Now we know
  that the cause and meaning of this difference is, that in the one case the original immigration is
  very remote and has never or very rarely been repeated, so that under the unchecked influence of
  new conditions of life the species have become modified; in the other case, either the original
  immigration has been recent, or if remote has been so frequently repeated that the new comers have
  kept up the purity of the stock, and have not allowed time for the new conditions to produce the
  effect we are sure they would in time produce if not counteracted. For Mr. Godman tells us that
  many of the birds are modified&mdash;instancing the gold-crested wren, blackcap, and rock
  dove&mdash;and he adds, that the <span class="pagenum" id="page208">{208}</span>modification all
  tends in one direction&mdash;to produce a more sombre plumage, a greater strength of feet and
  legs, and a more robust bill. We further find, that four of the land-birds, including the oriole,
  snow-bunting, and hoopoe, are not resident birds, but straggle accidentally to the islands by
  stress of weather; and we are told that every year some fresh birds are seen after violent storms.
  Add to this the fact, that the number of species diminishes in the group as we go from east to
  west, and that the islands are subject to fierce and frequent storms blowing from every point of
  the compass,&mdash;and we have all the facts requisite to enable us to understand how this remote
  archipelago has become stocked with animal life without ever probably being much nearer to Europe
  than it is now. For the islands are all volcanic, the only stratified rock that occurs being
  believed to be of Miocene date.</p>

  <p><i>Madeira and the Canaries.</i>&mdash;Coming next to Madeira, we find the number of genera of
  land birds has increased to twenty-eight, of which seventeen are identical with those of the
  Azores. Some of the commonest European birds&mdash;swallows, larks, sparrows, linnets,
  goldfinches, ravens, and partridges, are among the additions. A gold-crested warbler, <i>Regulus
  Maderensis</i>, and a pigeon, <i>Columba Trocaz</i>, are peculiar to Madeira.</p>

  <p>In the Canaries we find that the birds have again very much increased, there being more than
  fifty genera of land birds; but the additions are wholly European in character, and almost all
  common European species. We find a few more peculiar species (five), while some others, including
  the wild canary, are common to all the Atlantic Islands or to the Canaries and Madeira. Here, too,
  the only indigenous mammalia are two European species of bats.</p>

  <p><i>Land Shells.</i>&mdash;The land shells of Madeira offer us an instructive contrast to the
  birds of the Atlantic Islands. About fifty-six species have been found in Madeira, and forty-two
  in the small adjacent island of Porto Santo, but only twelve are common to both, and all or almost
  all are distinct from their nearest allies in Europe and North Africa. Great numbers of fossil
  shells are also found in deposits of the Newer Pliocene period; and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page209">{209}</span>although these comprise many fresh species, the two faunas and that of
  the continent still remain almost as distinct from each other as before. It has been already
  stated (p. <a href="#page31">31</a>) that the means by which land mollusca have been carried
  across arms of the sea are unknown, although several modes may be suggested; but it is evidently a
  rare event, requiring some concurrence of favourable conditions not always present. The diversity
  and specialization of the forms of these animals is, therefore, easily explained by the fact,
  that, once introduced they have been left to multiply under the influence of a variety of local
  conditions, which inevitably lead, in the course of ages, to the formation of new varieties and
  new species.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The beetles of Madeira and the Canaries have been so carefully
  collected and examined by Mr. T. V. Wollaston, and those of the Azores described and compared by
  Mr. Crotch, and they illustrate so many curious points in geographical distribution, that it is
  necessary to give some account of them. No less than 1,480 species of beetles have been obtained
  from the Canaries and Madeira, only 360 of which are European, the remainder being peculiar to the
  islands. The Canaries are inhabited by a little over 1,000 species, Madeira by about 700, while
  240 are common to both; but it is believed that many of these have been introduced by man. In the
  Azores, 212 species have been obtained, of which 175 are European; showing, as in the birds, as
  closer resemblance to the European fauna than in the other islands which, although nearer to the
  continent, offer more shelter and are situated in a less tempestuous zone. Of the non-European
  species in the Azores, 19 are found also in the other groups of islands, 14 are peculiar, while 3
  are American. Of the European species, 132 are found also in the other Atlantic islands, while 43
  have reached the Azores only. This is interesting as showing to how great an extent the same
  insects reach all the islands, notwithstanding the difference of latitude and position; and it
  becomes of great theoretical importance, when we find how many extensive families and genera are
  altogether absent.</p>

  <p>The Madeira group has been more thoroughly explored than <span class="pagenum"
  id="page210">{210}</span>any other, and its comparatively remote situation, combined with its
  luxuriant vegetation, have been favourable to the development and increase of the peculiar forms
  which characterize all the Atlantic islands in a more or less marked degree. A consideration of
  some of its peculiarities will, therefore, best serve to show the bearing of the facts presented
  by the insect fauna of the Atlantic islands, on the general laws of distribution. The 711 species
  of beetles now known from the Madeira group, belong to 236 genera; and no less than 44 of these
  genera are not European but are peculiar to the Atlantic islands. Most of them are, however,
  closely allied to European genera, of which they are evidently modifications. A most curious
  general feature presented by the Madeiran beetles, is the total absence of many whole families and
  large genera abundant in South Europe. Such are the Cicindelidæ, or tiger beetles; the
  Melolonthidæ, or chafers; the Cetoniidæ, or rose-chafers; the Eumolpidæ and Galerucidæ, large
  families of Phytophagous, or leaf-eating beetles; and also the extensive groups of Elateridæ and
  Buprestidæ, which are each represented by but one minute species. Of extensive genera abundant in
  South Europe, but wholly absent in Madeira, are <i>Carabus</i>, <i>Rhizotrogus</i>,
  <i>Lampyris</i>, and other genera of Malacoderms; <i>Otiorhynchus</i>, <i>Brachycerus</i>, and 20
  other genera of Curculionidæ, comprising more than 300 South European and North African species;
  <i>Pimelia</i>, <i>Tentyra</i>, <i>Blaps</i>, and 18 other genera of Heteromera, comprising about
  550 species in South Europe and North Africa; and <i>Timarcha</i>, containing 44 South European
  and North African species.</p>

  <p>Another most remarkable feature of the Madeiran Coleoptera is the unusual prevalence of
  apterous or wingless insects. This is especially the case with groups which are confined to the
  Atlantic islands, many of which consist wholly of wingless species; but it also affects the
  others, no less than twenty-two genera which are usually or sometimes winged in Europe, having
  only wingless species in Madeira; and even the same species which is winged in Europe becomes, in
  at least three cases, wingless in Madeira, without any other perceptible change having taken
  place. But there is another most curious fact noticed by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page211">{211}</span>Mr. Wollaston; that those species which possess wings in Madeira, often
  have them rather larger than their allies in Europe. These two facts were connected by Mr. Darwin,
  who suggested that flying insects are much more exposed to be blown out to sea and lost, than
  those which do not fly (and Mr. Wollaston had himself supposed that the "stormy atmosphere" of
  Madeira had something to do with the matter); so that the most frequent fliers would be
  continually weeded out, while the more sluggish individuals, who either could not or would not
  fly, remained to continue the race; and this process going on from generation to generation,
  would, on the well-ascertained principles of selection and abortion by disuse, in time lead to the
  entire loss of wings by those insects to whom wings were <i>not a necessity</i>. But those whose
  wings were essential to their existence would be acted upon in another way. All these must fly to
  obtain their food or provide for their offspring, and those that flew best would be best able to
  battle with the storms, and keep themselves safe, and thus those with the longest and most
  powerful wings would be preserved. If however all the individuals of the species were too weak on
  the wing to resist the storms, they would soon become extinct.<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now this explanation of the facts is not only simple and probable in itself, but it also serves
  to explain in a remarkable manner some of the peculiarities and deficiencies of the Madeiran
  insect fauna, in harmony with the view (supported by the distribution of the birds and land
  shells, and in particular by the immigrant birds and insects of the Azores) that all the insects
  have been derived from the continent or from other islands, by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page212">{212}</span>immigration across the ocean, in various ways and during a long period.
  These deficiencies are, on the other hand, quite inconsistent with the theory (still held by some
  entomologists) that a land communication is absolutely necessary to account for the origin of the
  Madeiran fauna.</p>

  <p>First, then, we can understand how the tiger-beetles (Cicindelidæ) are absent; since they are
  insects which have a short weak flight, but yet to whom flight is necessary. If a few had been
  blown over to Madeira, they would soon have become exterminated. The same thing applies to the
  Melolonthidæ, Cetoniidæ, Eumolpidæ, and Galerucidæ,&mdash;all flower and foliage-haunting insects,
  yet bulky and of comparatively feeble powers of flight. Again, all the large genera abundant in
  South Europe, which have been mentioned above as absent from Madeira, are wholly apterous (or
  without wings), and thus their absence is a most significant fact; for it proves that in the case
  of all insects of moderate size, flight was essential to their reaching the island, which could
  not have been the case had there been a land connection. There are, however, one or two curious
  exceptions to the absence of these wholly apterous European genera in Madeira, and as in each case
  the reason of their being exceptions can be pointed out, they are eminently exceptions that prove
  the rule. Two of the apterous species common to Europe and Madeira are found always in ants'
  nests; and as ants, when winged, fly in great swarms and are carried by the wind to great
  distances, they may have conveyed the minute eggs of these very small beetles. Two European
  species of <i>Blaps</i> occur in Madeira, but these are house beetles, and are admitted to have
  been introduced by man. There are also three species of <i>Meloe</i>, of which two are European
  and one peculiar. These are large, sluggish, wingless insects, but they have a most extraordinary
  and exceptional metamorphosis, the larvae in the first state being minute active insects parasitic
  on bees, and thus easily conveyed across the ocean. This case is most suggestive, as it accounts
  for what would be otherwise a difficult anomaly. Another case, not quite so easily explained, is
  that of the genus <i>Acalles</i>, which is very abundant in all the Atlantic <span class="pagenum"
  id="page213">{213}</span>islands and also occurs in South Europe, but is always apterous. It is
  however closely allied to another genus, <i>Cryptorhynchus</i>, which is apterous in some species,
  winged in others. We may therefore well suppose that the ancestors of <i>Acalles</i> were once in
  the same condition, and that some of the winged forms reached Madeira, the genus having since
  become wholly apterous.</p>

  <p>We may look at this curious subject in another way. The Coleoptera of Madeira may be divided
  into those which are found also in Europe or the other islands, and those which are peculiar to
  it. On the theory of introduction by accidental immigration across the sea, the latter must be the
  more ancient, since they have had time to become modified; while the former are comparatively
  recent, and their introduction may be supposed to be now going on. The peculiar influence of
  Madeira in aborting the wings should, therefore, have acted on the ancient and changed forms much
  more powerfully than on the recent and unchanged forms. On carefully comparing the two sets of
  insects (omitting those which have almost certainly been introduced by man) we find, that out of
  263 species which have a wide range, only 14 are apterous; while the other class, consisting of
  393 species, has no less than 178 apterous; or about 5 per cent in the one case, and 45 per cent
  in the other.<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> On the theory of a land connection as
  the main agent in introducing the fauna, both groups must have been introduced at or about the
  same time, and why one set should have lost their wings and the other not, is quite
  inexplicable.</p>

  <p>Taking all these singular facts, in connection with the total absence of all truly indigenous
  terrestrial mammalia and reptiles from these islands&mdash;even from the extensive group of the
  Canaries so comparatively near to the continent, we are forced to reject the theory of a land
  connection as quite untenable; and this view becomes almost demonstrated by the case of the
  Azores, which being so much further off, and surrounded by such a vast expanse of deep ocean,
  could only have been <span class="pagenum" id="page214">{214}</span>connected with Europe at a far
  remoter epoch, and ought therefore to exhibit to us a fauna composed almost entirely of peculiar
  forms both of birds and insects. Yet, so far from this being the case, the facts are exactly the
  reverse. Far more of the birds and insects are identical with those of Europe than in the other
  islands, and this difference is clearly traced to the more tempestuous atmosphere, which is shown
  to be even now annually bringing fresh immigrants (both birds and insects) to its shores. We here
  see nature actually at work; and if the case of Madeira rendered her mode of action probable, that
  of the Azores may be said to demonstrate it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wollaston has objected to this view that "storms and hurricanes" are somewhat rare in the
  latitude of Madeira and the Canaries; but this little affects the question, since the <i>time</i>
  allowed for such operations is so ample. If but one very violent storm happened in a century, and
  ten such storms recurred before a single species of insect was introduced into Madeira, that would
  be more than sufficient to people it, as we now find it, with a varied fauna. But he also adds the
  important information that the ordinary winds blow almost uninterruptedly from the north-east, so
  that there would be always a chance of a little stronger wind than usual bringing insect, or
  larva, or egg, attached to leaves or twigs. Neither Mr. Wollaston, Mr. Crotch, Mr. A. Murray, nor
  any other naturalist who upholds the land-connection theory, has attempted to account for the fact
  of the absence of so many extensive groups of insects that ought to be present, as well as of all
  small mammalia and reptiles.</p>

  <p><i>Cape Verd Islands.</i>&mdash;There is yet another group of Atlantic islands which is very
  little known, and which is usually considered to be altogether African&mdash;the Cape Verd
  Islands, situated between 300 and 400 miles west of Senegal, and a little to the south of the
  termination of the Sahara. The evidence that we possess as to the productions of these islands,
  shows that, like the preceding groups, they are truly oceanic, and have probably derived their
  fauna from the desert and the Canaries to the north-east of them rather than from the fertile and
  more truly <span class="pagenum" id="page215">{215}</span>Ethiopian districts of Senegal and
  Gambia to the east. There is a mingling of the two faunas, but the preponderance seems to be
  undoubtedly with the Palæarctic rather than with the Ethiopian. I owe to Mr. R. B. Sharpe of the
  British Museum, a MS. list of the birds of these islands, twenty-three species in all. Of these
  eight are of wide distribution and may be neglected. Seven are undoubted Palæarctic species,
  viz.:&mdash;<i>Milvus ictinus</i>, <i>Sylvia atricapilla</i>, <i>S. conspicillata</i>, <i>Corvus
  corone</i>, <i>Passer salicarius</i>, <i>Certhilauda desertorum</i>, <i>Columba livia</i>. Three
  are peculiar species, but of Palæarctic genera and affinities, viz.:&mdash;<i>Calamoherpe
  brevipennis</i>, <i>Ammomanes cinctura</i>, and <i>Passer jagoensis</i>. Against this we have to
  set two West African species, <i>Estrilda cinerea</i> and <i>Numida meleagris</i>, both of which
  were probably introduced by man; and three which are of Ethiopian genera and affinities,
  viz.:&mdash;<i>Halcyon erythrorhyncha</i>, closely allied to <i>H. semicærulea</i> of Arabia and
  North-east Africa, and therefore almost Palæarctic; <i>Accipiter melanoleucus</i>; and
  <i>Pyrrhulauda nigriceps</i>, an Ethiopian form; but the same species occurs in the Canaries.</p>

  <p>The Coleoptera of these islands have been also collected by Mr. Wollaston, and he finds that
  they have generally the same European character as those of the Canaries and Madeira, several of
  the peculiar Atlantic genera, such as <i>Acalles</i> and <i>Hegeter</i>, occurring, while others
  are represented by new but closely allied genera. Out of 275 species 91 were found also in the
  Canaries and 81 in the Madeiran group; a wonderful amount of similarity when we consider the
  distance and isolation of these islands and their great diversity of climate and vegetation.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This connection of the four groups of Atlantic islands now referred to, receives
  further support from the occurrence of land-shells of the subgenus <i>Leptaxis</i> in all the
  groups, as well as in Majorca; and by another subgenus, <i>Hemicycla</i>, being common to the
  Canaries and Cape Verd islands. Combining these several classes of facts, we seem justified in
  extending the Mediterranean sub-region to include the Cape Verd Islands.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page216">{216}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>III.&mdash;The Siberian Sub-region, or Northern Asia.</i></p>

  <p>This large and comparatively little-known subdivision of the Palæarctic region, extends from
  the Caspian Sea to Kamschatka and Behring's Straits, a distance of about 4,000 miles; and from the
  shores of the Arctic Ocean to the high Himalayas of Sikhim in North Latitude 29°, on the same
  parallel as Delhi. To the east of the Caspian Sea and the Ural Mountains is a great extent of
  lowland which is continued round the northern coast, becoming narrower as it approaches the East
  Cape. Beyond this, in a general E.N.E. direction, rise hills and uplands, soon becoming lofty
  mountains, which extend in an unbroken line from the Hindu Koosh, through the Thian Shan, Altai
  and Yablonoi Mountains, to the Stanovoi range in the north-eastern extremity of Asia. South of
  this region is a great central basin, which is almost wholly desert; beyond which again is the
  vast plateau of Thibet, with the Kuenlun, Karakorum, and Himalayan snow-capped ranges, forming the
  most extensive elevated district on the globe.</p>

  <p>The superficial aspects of this vast territory, as determined by its vegetable covering, are
  very striking and well contrasted. A broad tract on the northern coast, varying from 150 to 300
  and even 500 miles wide, is occupied by the Tundras or barrens, where nothing grows but mosses and
  the dwarfest Arctic plants, and where the ground is permanently frozen to a great depth. This
  tract has its greatest southern extension between the rivers Obi and Yenesi, where it reaches the
  parallel of 60° north latitude. Next to this comes a vast extent of northern forests, mostly of
  conifers in the more northern and lofty situations, while deciduous trees preponderate in the
  southern portions and in the more sheltered valleys. The greatest extension of this forest region
  is north of Lake Baikal, where it is more than 1,200 miles wide. These forests extend along the
  mountain ranges to join those of the Hindu Koosh. South of the forests the remainder of the
  sub-region consists of open pasture-lands and vast intervening deserts, of which the Gobi, and
  those of Turkestan between the Aral and Balkash lakes, are the most <span class="pagenum"
  id="page217">{217}</span>extensive. The former is nearly 1,000 miles long, with a width of from
  200 to 350 miles, and is almost as complete a desert as the Sahara.</p>

  <p>With very few exceptions, this vast territory is exposed to an extreme climate, inimical to
  animal life. All the lower parts being situated to the north, have an excessively cold winter, so
  that the limit of constantly frozen ground descends below the parallel of 60° north latitude. To
  the south, the land is greatly elevated, and the climate extremely dry. In summer the heat is
  excessive, while the winter is almost as severe as further north. The whole country, too, is
  subject to violent storms, both in summer and winter; and the rich vegetation that clothes the
  steppes in spring, is soon parched up and replaced by dusty plains. Under these adverse influences
  we cannot expect animal life to be so abundant as in those sub-regions subject to more favourable
  physical conditions; yet the country is so extensive and so varied, that it does actually, as we
  shall see, possess a very considerable and interesting fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Four genera seem to be absolutely confined to this sub-region,
  <i>Nectogale</i>, a peculiar form of the mole family (Talpidæ); <i>Poephagus</i>, the yak, or
  hairy bison of Thibet; with <i>Procapra</i> and <i>Pantholops</i>, Thibetan antelopes. Some others
  more especially belong here, although they just enter Europe, as <i>Saiga</i>, the Tartarian
  antelope; <i>Sminthus</i>, a desert rat;, and <i>Ellobius</i>, a burrowing mole-rat; while
  <i>Myospalax</i>, a curious rodent allied to the voles, is found only in the Altai mountains and
  North China; and <i>Moschus</i>, the musk-deer, is almost confined to this sub-region. Among the
  characteristic animals of the extreme north, are <i>Mustela</i>, and <i>Martes</i>, including the
  ermine and sable; <i>Gulo</i>, the glutton; <i>Tarandus</i>, the reindeer; <i>Myodes</i>, the
  lemming; with the lynx, arctic fox, and polar bear; and here, in the Post-pliocene epoch, ranged
  the hairy rhinoceros and Siberian mammoth, whose entire bodies still remain preserved in the
  ice-cliffs near the mouths of the great rivers. Farther south, species of wild cat, bear, wolf,
  deer, and pika (<i>Lagomys</i>) abound; while in the mountains we find wild goats and sheep of
  several species, and in the plains and deserts wild horses <span class="pagenum"
  id="page218">{218}</span>and asses, gazelles, two species of antelopes, flying squirrels
  (<i>Pteromys</i>), ground squirrels (<i>Tamias</i>), marmots, of the genus <i>Spermophilus</i>,
  with camels and dromedaries, probably natives of the south-western part of this sub-region. The
  most abundant and conspicuous of the mammalia are the great herds of reindeer in the north, the
  wolves of the steppes, with the wild horses, goats, sheep, and antelopes of the plateaus and
  mountains.</p>

  <p>Among the curiosities of this sub-region we must notice the seal, found in the inland and
  freshwater lake Baikal, at an elevation of about 2,000 feet above the sea. It is a species of
  <i>Callocephalus</i>, closely allied to, if not identical with, one inhabiting northern seas as
  well as the Caspian and Lake Aral. This would indicate that almost all northern Asia was depressed
  beneath the sea very recently; and Mr. Belt's view, of the ice during the glacial epoch having
  dammed up the rivers and converted much of Siberia into a vast freshwater or brackish lake,
  perhaps offers the best solution of the difficulty.<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Plate II.&mdash;Characteristic Mammalia of Western Tartary.</i>&mdash;Several of the most
  remarkable animals of the Palæarctic region inhabit Western Tartary, and are common to the
  European and Siberian sub-regions. We therefore choose this district for one of our illustrative
  plates. The large animals in the centre are the remarkable saiga antelopes (<i>Saiga
  Tartarica</i>), distinguished from all others by a large and fleshy proboscis-like nose, which
  gives them a singular appearance. They differ so much from all other antelopes that they have been
  formed into a distinct family by some naturalists, but are here referred to the great family
  Bovidæ. They inhabit the open plains from Poland to the Irtish River. On the left is the mole-rat,
  or sand-rat (<i>Spalax murinus</i>). This animal burrows under ground like a mole, feeding on
  bulbous roots. It inhabits the same country as the saiga, but extends farther south in Europe. On
  the right is a still more curious animal, the desman (<i>Myogale Muscovitica</i>), a long-snouted
  water-mole. This creature is fifteen inches long, including the tail; it burrows in the banks of
  streams, feeding on insects, <span class="pagenum" id="page219">{219}</span>worms, and leeches; it
  swims well, and remains long under water, raising the tip of the snout, where the nostrils are
  situated, to the surface when it wants to breathe. It is thus well concealed; and this may be one
  use of the development of the long snout, as well as serving to follow worms into their holes in
  the soft earth. This species is confined to the rivers Volga and Don in Southern Russia, and the
  only other species known inhabits some of the valleys on the north side of the Pyrenees. In the
  distance are wolves, a characteristic feature of these wastes.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="fine">CHARACTERISTIC MAMMALIA OF
  WESTERN TARTARY.</span></p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;But few genera of birds are absolutely restricted to this sub-region.
  <i>Podoces</i>, a curious form of starling, is the most decidedly so; <i>Mycerobas</i> and
  <i>Pyrrhospiza</i> are genera of finches confined to Thibet and the snowy Himalayas;
  <i>Leucosticte</i>, another genus of finches, is confined to the eastern half of the sub-region
  and North America; <i>Tetraogallus</i>, a large kind of partridge, ranges west to the Caucasus;
  <i>Syrrhaptes</i>, a form of sand-grouse, and <i>Lerwa</i> (snow-partridge), are almost confined
  here, only extending into the next sub-region; as do <i>Grandala</i>, and <i>Calliope</i>, genera
  of warblers, <i>Uragus</i>, a finch allied to the North American cardinals, and
  <i>Crossoptilon</i>, a remarkable group of pheasants.</p>

  <p>Almost all the genera of central and northern Europe are found here, and give quite a European
  character to the ornithology, though a considerable number of the species are different. There are
  a few Oriental forms, such as <i>Abrornis</i> and <i>Larvivora</i> (warblers); with
  <i>Ceriornis</i> and <i>Ithaginis</i>, genera of pheasants, which reach the snow-line in the
  Himalayas and thus just enter this sub-region, but as they do not penetrate farther north, they
  hardly serve to modify the exclusively Palæarctic character of its ornithology.</p>

  <p>According to Middendorf, the extreme northern Asiatic birds are the Alpine ptarmigan
  (<i>Lagopus mutus</i>); the snow-bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>); the raven, the gyrfalcon
  and the snowy-owl. Those which are characteristic of the barren "tundras," but which do not range
  so far north as the preceding are,&mdash;the willow-grouse (<i>Lagopus albus</i>); the
  Lapland-bunting (<i>Plectrophanes <span class="pagenum" id="page220">{220}</span>lapponica</i>);
  the shore-lark (<i>Otocorys alpestris</i>); the sand-martin (<i>Cotyle riparia</i>), and the
  sea-eagle (<i>Haliæetus albicilla</i>).</p>

  <p>Those which are more characteristic of the northern forests, and which do not pass beyond them,
  are&mdash;the linnet; two crossbills (<i>Loxia Leucoptera</i> and <i>L. Curvirostra</i>); the pine
  grosbeak (<i>Pinicola enucleator</i>); the waxwing; the common magpie; the common swallow; the
  peregrine falcon; the rough-legged buzzard; and three species of owls.</p>

  <p>Fully one-half of the land-birds of Siberia are identical with those of Europe, the remainder
  being mostly representative species peculiar to Northern Asia, with a few stragglers and
  immigrants from China and Japan or the Himalayas. A much larger proportion of the wading and
  aquatic families are European or Arctic, these groups having always a wider range than land
  birds.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;From the nature of the country and climate these are
  comparatively few, but in the more temperate districts snakes and lizards seem to be not uncommon.
  <i>Halys</i>, a genus of Crotaline snakes, and <i>Phrynocephalus</i>, lizards of the family
  Agamidæ, are characteristic of these parts. <i>Simotes</i>, a snake of the family Oligodontidæ,
  reaches an elevation of 16,000 feet in the Himalayas, and therefore enters this sub-region.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;<i>Mesapia</i> and <i>Hypermnestra</i>, genera of
  Papilionidæ, are butterflies peculiar to this sub-region; and <i>Parnassius</i> is as
  characteristic as it is of our European mountains. Carabidæ are also abundant, as will be seen by
  referring to the Chapter on the Distribution of Insects in the succeeding part of this work. The
  insects, on the whole, have a strictly European character, although a large proportion of the
  species are peculiar, and several new genera appear.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>IV.&mdash;Japan and North China, or the Manchurian Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This is an interesting and very productive district, corresponding in the east to the
  Mediterranean sub-region in the west, or rather perhaps to all western temperate Europe. Its
  limits are not very well defined, but it probably includes all Japan; the Corea and Manchuria to
  the Amour river and to the lower <span class="pagenum" id="page221">{221}</span>slopes of the
  Khingan and Peling mountains; and China to the Nanlin mountains south of the Yang-tse-kiang. On
  the coast of China the dividing line between it and the Oriental region seems to be somewhere
  about Foo-chow, but as there is here no natural barrier, a great intermingling of northern and
  southern forms takes place.</p>

  <p>Japan is volcanic and mountainous, with a fine climate and a most luxuriant and varied
  vegetation. Manchuria is hilly, with a high range of mountains on the coast, and some desert
  tracts in the interior, but fairly wooded in many parts. Much of northern China is a vast alluvial
  plain, backed by hills and mountains with belts of forest, above which are the dry and barren
  uplands of Mongolia. We have a tolerable knowledge of China, of Japan, and of the Amoor valley,
  but very little of Corea and Manchuria. The recent researches of Père David in Moupin, in east
  Thibet, said to be between 31° and 32° north latitude, show, that the fauna of the Oriental region
  here advances northward along the flanks of the Yun-ling mountains (a continuation of the
  Himalayas); since he found at different altitudes representatives of the Indo-Chinese, Manchurian,
  and Siberian faunas. On the higher slopes of the Himalayas, there must be a narrow strip from
  about 8,000 to 11,000 feet elevation intervening between the tropical fauna of the Indo-Chinese
  sub-region and the almost arctic fauna of Thibet; and the animals of this zone will for the most
  part belong to the fauna of temperate China and Manchuria, except in the extreme west towards
  Cashmere, where the Mediterranean fauna will in like manner intervene. On a map of sufficiently
  large scale, therefore, it would be necessary to extend our present sub-region westward along the
  Himalayas, in a narrow strip just below the upper limits of forests. It is evident that the large
  number of Fringillidæ, Corvidæ, Troglodytidæ, and Paridæ, often of south Palæarctic forms, that
  abound in the higher Himalayas, are somewhat out of place as members of the Oriental fauna, and
  are equally so in that of Thibet and Siberia; but they form a natural portion of that of North
  China on the one side, or of South Europe on the other.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page222">{222}</span></div>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;This sub-region contains a number of peculiar and very interesting
  forms, most of which have been recently discovered by Père David in North and West China and East
  Thibet. The following are the peculiar genera:&mdash;<i>Rhinopithecus</i>, a sub-genus of monkeys,
  here classed under <i>Semnopithecus</i>; <i>Anurosorex</i>, <i>Scaptochirus</i>, <i>Uropsilus</i>
  and <i>Scaptonyx</i>, new forms of Talpidæ or moles; <i>Æluropus</i> (Æluridæ); <i>Nyctereutes</i>
  (Canidæ); <i>Lutronectes</i> (Mustelidæ); <i>Cricetulus</i> (Muridæ); <i>Hydropotes</i>,
  <i>Moschus</i>, and <i>Elaphodus</i> (Cervidæ). The <i>Rhinopithecus</i> appears to be a permanent
  inhabitant of the highest forests of Moupin, in a cold climate. It has a very thick fur, as has
  also a new species of <i>Macacus</i> found in the same district. North China and East Thibet seem
  to be very rich in Insectivora. <i>Scaptochirus</i> is like a mole; <i>Uropsilus</i> between the
  Japanese <i>Urotrichus</i> and <i>Sorex</i>; <i>Scaptonyx</i> between <i>Urotrichus</i> and
  <i>Talpa</i>. <i>Æluropus</i> seems to be the most remarkable mammal discovered by Père David. It
  is allied to the singular panda (<i>Ælurus fulgens</i>) of Nepal, but is as large as a bear, the
  body wholly white, with the feet, ears, and tip of the tail black. It inhabits the highest
  forests, and is therefore a true Palæarctic animal, as most likely is the <i>Ælurus</i>.
  <i>Nyctereutes</i>, a curious racoon-like dog, ranges from Canton to North China, the Amoor and
  Japan, and therefore seems to come best in this sub-region; <i>Hydropotes</i> and
  <i>Lophotragus</i> are small hornless deer confined to North China; <i>Elaphodus</i>, from East
  Thibet, is another peculiar form of deer; while the musk deer (<i>Moschus</i>) is confined to this
  sub-region and the last. Besides the above, the following Palæarctic genera were found by Père
  David in this sub-region: <i>Macacus</i>: five genera or sub-genera of bats (<i>Vespertilio</i>,
  <i>Vesperus</i>, <i>Vesperugo</i>, <i>Rhinolophus</i>, and <i>Murina</i>); <i>Erinaceus</i>,
  <i>Nectogale</i>, <i>Talpa</i>, <i>Crocidura</i> and <i>Sorex</i>, among Insectivora;
  <i>Mustela</i>, <i>Putorius</i>, <i>Martes</i>, <i>Lutra</i>, <i>Viverra</i>, <i>Meles</i>,
  <i>Ælurus</i>, <i>Ursus</i>, <i>Felis</i>, and <i>Canis</i>, among <i>Carnivora</i>;
  <i>Hystrix</i>, <i>Arctomys</i>, <i>Myospalax</i>, <i>Spermophilus</i>, <i>Gerbillus</i>,
  <i>Dipus</i>, <i>Lagomys</i>, <i>Lepus</i>, <i>Sciurus</i>, <i>Pteromys</i>, <i>Arvicola</i>, and
  <i>Mus</i>, among Rodentia; <i>Budorcas</i>, <i>Nemorhedus</i>, <i>Antilope</i>, <i>Ovis</i>,
  <i>Moschus</i>, <i>Cervulus</i> and <i>Cervus</i> among Ruminants; and the wide-spread <i>Sus</i>
  or wild boar. The following Oriental genera are also <span class="pagenum"
  id="page223">{223}</span>included in Père David's list, but no doubt occur only in the lowlands
  and warm valleys, and can hardly be considered to belong to the Palæarctic region: <i>Paguma</i>,
  <i>Helictis</i>, <i>Arctonyx</i>, <i>Rhizomys</i>, <i>Manis</i>. The <i>Rhizomys</i> from Moupin
  is a peculiar species of this tropical genus, but all the others inhabit Southern China.</p>

  <p>A few additional forms occur in Japan: <i>Urotrichus</i>, a peculiar Mole, which is found also
  in north-west America; <i>Enhydra</i>, the sea otter of California; and the dormouse
  (<i>Myoxus</i>). Japan also possesses peculiar species of <i>Macacus</i>, <i>Talpa</i>,
  <i>Meles</i>, <i>Canis</i>, and <i>Sciuropterus</i>.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that this sub-region is remarkably rich in Insectivora, of which it possesses
  ten genera; and that it has also several peculiar forms of Carnivora, Rodentia, and Ruminants.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;To give an accurate idea of the ornithology of this sub-region is very
  difficult, both on account of its extreme richness and the impossibility of defining the limits
  between it and the Oriental region. A considerable number of genera which are well developed in
  the high Himalayas, and some which are peculiar to that district, have hitherto always been
  classed as Indian, and therefore Oriental groups; but they more properly belong to this
  sub-region. Many of them frequent the highest forests, or descend into the Himalayan temperate
  zone only in winter; and others are so intimately connected with Palæarctic species, that they can
  only be considered as stragglers into the border land of the Oriental region. On these principles
  we consider the following genera to be confined to this sub-region<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><i>Grandala</i>, <i>Nemura</i> (Sylviidæ); <i>Pterorhinus</i> (Timaliidæ); <i>Cholornis</i>,
  <i>Conostoma</i>, <i>Heteromorpha</i> (Panuridæ); <i>Cyanoptila</i> (Muscicapidæ); <i>Eophona</i>
  (Fringillidæ); <i>Dendrotreron</i> (Columbidæ); <i>Lophophorus</i>, <i>Tetraophasis</i>,
  <i>Crossoptilon</i>, <i>Pucrasia</i>, <i>Thaumalea</i>, and <i>Ithaginis</i> (Phasianidæ). This
  may be called the sub-region of Pheasants; for the above six genera, comprising sixteen species of
  the most magnificent birds in the world, are all confined to the temperate or cold mountainous
  regions of the Himalayas, Thibet, and China; and in addition we have <span class="pagenum"
  id="page224">{224}</span>most of the species of tragopan (<i>Ceriornis</i>), and some of the true
  pheasants (<i>Phasianus</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp4">The most abundant and characteristic of the smaller birds are warblers, tits, and
  finches, of Palæarctic types; but there are also a considerable number of Oriental forms which
  penetrate far into the country, and mingling with the northern birds give a character to the
  Ornithology of this sub-region very different from that of the Mediterranean district at the
  western end of the region. Leaving out a large number of wide-ranging groups, this mixture of
  types may be best exhibited by giving lists of the more striking Palæarctic and Oriental genera
  which are here found intermingled.</p>

  <p>In the above lists there are rather more Oriental than Palæarctic genera; but it must be
  remembered that most of the former are summer migrants only, or stragglers just entering the
  sub-region; whereas the great majority of the latter are permanent residents, and a large
  proportion of them range over the greater part of the Manchurian district. Many of those in the
  Oriental column should perhaps be omitted, as we have no exact determination of their range, and
  the limits of the regions are very uncertain. It must be remembered, too, that the Palæarctic
  genera of Sylviidæ, Paridæ, and Fringillidæ, are often represented by numerous species, whereas
  the corresponding Oriental genera have for the most part only single species; and we shall then
  find that, except towards the borders of the Oriental region the Palæarctic element is strongly
  predominant. Four of the more especially Oriental groups are confined to Japan, the southern <span
  class="pagenum" id="page226">{226}</span>extremity of which should perhaps come in the Oriental
  region. The great richness of this sub-region compared with that of Siberia is well shown by the
  fact, that a list of all the known land-birds of East Siberia, including Dahuria and the
  comparatively fertile Amoor Valley, contains only 190 species; whereas Père David's catalogue of
  the birds of Northern China with adjacent parts of East Thibet and Mongolia (a very much smaller
  area) contains for the same families 366 species. Of the Siberian birds more than 50 per cent, are
  European species, while those of the Manchurian sub-region comprise about half that proportion of
  land-birds which are identical with those of Europe.</p>

  <p>Japan is no doubt very imperfectly known, as only 134 land-birds are recorded from it. Of these
  twenty-two are peculiar species, a number that would probably be diminished were the Corea to be
  explored. Of the genera, only nine are Indo-Malayan, while forty-three are Palæarctic.</p>

  <p><i>Plate III.&mdash;Scene on the Borders of North-West China and Mongolia with Characteristic
  Mammalia and Birds.</i>&mdash;The mountainous districts of Northern China, with the adjacent
  portions of Thibet and Mongolia, are the head-quarters of the pheasant tribe, many of the most
  beautiful and remarkable species being found there only. In the north-western provinces of China
  and the southern parts of Mongolia may be found the species figured. That in the foreground is the
  superb golden pheasant (<i>Thaumalea picta</i>), a bird that can hardly be surpassed for splendour
  of plumage by any denizen of the tropics. The large bird perched above is the eared pheasant
  (<i>Crossoptilon auritum</i>), a species of comparatively sober plumage but of remarkable and
  elegant form. In the middle distance is Pallas's sand grouse (<i>Syrrhaptes paradoxus</i>), a
  curious bird, whose native country seems to be the high plains of Northern Asia, but which often
  abounds near Pekin, and in 1863 astonished European ornithologists by appearing in considerable
  numbers in Central and Western Europe, in every part of Great Britain, and even in Ireland.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="fine">CHARACTERISTIC ANIMALS OF NORTH
  CHINA.</span></p>

  <p>The quadruped figured is the curious racoon dog (<i>Nyctereutes procyonoides</i>), <span
  class="pagenum" id="page227">{227}</span>an animal confined to North China, Japan, and the Amoor
  Valley, and having no close allies in any other part of the globe. In the distance are some deer,
  a group of animals very abundant and varied in this part of the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Reptiles are scarce in North China, only four or five
  species of snakes, a lizard and one of the Geckotidæ occurring in the country round Pekin. The
  genus <i>Halys</i> is the most characteristic form of snake, while <i>Callophis</i>, an oriental
  genus, extends to Japan. Among lizards, <i>Plestiodon</i>, <i>Maybouya</i>, <i>Tachydromus</i>,
  and <i>Gecko</i> reach Japan, the two latter being very characteristic of the Oriental region.</p>

  <p>Amphibia are more abundant and interesting; <i>Hynobius</i>, <i>Onychodactylus</i>, and
  <i>Sieboldtia</i> (Salamandridæ) being peculiar to it, while most of the European genera are also
  represented.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fish.</i>&mdash;Of these there are a few peculiar genera; as <i>Plecoglossus</i>
  (Salmonidæ) from Japan; <i>Achilognathus</i>, <i>Pseudoperilampus</i>, <i>Ochetobius</i>, and
  <i>Opsariichthys</i> (Cyprinidæ); and there are many other Chinese Cyprinidæ belonging to the
  border land of the Palæarctic and Oriental regions.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The butterflies of this sub-region exhibit the same mixture of tropical
  and temperate forms as the birds. Most of the common European genera are represented, and there
  are species of <i>Parnassius</i> in Japan and the Amoor. <i>Isodema</i>, a peculiar genus of
  Nymphalidæ is found near Ningpo, just within our limits; and <i>Sericinus</i>, one of the most
  beautiful genera of Papilionidæ is peculiar to North China, where four species occur, thus
  balancing the <i>Thais</i> and <i>Doritis</i> of Europe. The genus <i>Zephyrus</i> (Lycænidæ) is
  well represented by six species in Japan and the Amoor, against two in Europe. <i>Papilio
  paris</i> and <i>P. bianor</i>, magnificent insects of wholly tropical appearance, abound near
  Pekin, and allied forms inhabit Japan and the Amoor, as well as <i>P. demetrius</i> and <i>P.
  alcinous</i> belonging to the "Protenor" group of the Himalayas. Other tropical genera occurring
  in Japan, the Amoor, or North China are, <i>Debis</i>, <i>Neope</i>, <i>Mycalesis</i>,
  <i>Ypthimia</i> (Satyridæ); <i>Thaumantis</i> (Morphidæ), at Shanghae; <i>Euripus</i>,
  <i>Neptis</i>, <i>Athyma</i> (Nymphalidæ); <i>Terias</i> (Pieridæ); and the above-mentioned
  Papilionidæ.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page228">{228}</span></div>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The beetles of Japan decidedly exhibit a mixture of tropical forms
  with others truly Palæarctic, and it has been with some naturalists a matter of doubt whether the
  southern and best known portion of the islands should not be joined to the Oriental region. An
  important addition to our knowledge of the insects of this country has recently been made by Mr.
  George Lewis, and a portion of his collections have been described by various entomologists in the
  <i>Transactions of the Entomological Society of London</i>. As the question is one of considerable
  interest we shall give a summary of the results fairly deducible from what is now known of the
  entomology of Japan; and it must be remembered that almost all our collections come from the
  southern districts, in what is almost a sub-tropical climate; so that if we find a considerable
  proportion of Palæarctic forms, we may be pretty sure that the preponderance will be much greater
  a little further north.</p>

  <p>Of Carabidæ Mr. Bates enumerates 244 species belonging to 84 genera, and by comparing these
  with the Coleoptera of a tract of about equal extent in western Europe, he concludes that there is
  little similarity, and that the cases of affinity to the forms of eastern tropical Asia
  preponderate. By comparing his genera with the distributions as given in <i>Gemminger and Harold's
  Catalogue</i>, a somewhat different result is arrived at. Leaving out the generic types altogether
  peculiar to Japan, and also those genera of such world-wide distribution that they afford no clear
  indications for our purpose, it appears that no less than twenty-two genera, containing
  seventy-four of the Japanese species, are either exclusively Palæarctic, Palæarctic and Nearctic,
  or highly characteristic of the Palæarctic region; then come thirteen genera containing
  eighty-seven of the species which have a very wide distribution, but are also Palæarctic: we next
  have seventeen genera containing twenty-four of the Japanese species which are decidedly Oriental
  and tropical. Here then the fair comparison is between the twenty-two genera and seventy-four
  species whose affinities are clearly Palæarctic or at least north temperate, and seventeen genera
  with twenty-four species which are Asiatic and tropical; and this seems to prove that, although
  South <span class="pagenum" id="page229">{229}</span>Japan (like North China) has a considerable
  infusion of tropical forms, there is a preponderating substratum of Palæarctic forms, which
  clearly indicate the true position of the islands in zoological geography. There are also a few
  cases of what may be called eccentric distribution; which show that Japan, like many other
  island-groups, has served as a kind of refuge in which dying-out forms continue to maintain
  themselves. These, which are worthy of notice, are as follows: <i>Orthotrichus</i> (1 sp.) has the
  only other species in Egypt; <i>Trechichus</i> (1 sp.) has two other species, of which one
  inhabits Madeira, the other the Southern United States; <i>Perileptus</i> (1 sp.) has two other
  species, of which one inhabits Bourbon, the other West Europe; and lastly, <i>Crepidogaster</i> (1
  sp.) has the other known species in South Africa. These cases diminish the value of the
  indications afforded by some of the Japanese forms, whose only allies are single species in
  various remote parts of the Oriental region.</p>

  <p>The Staphylinidæ have been described by Dr. Sharp, and his list exhibits a great preponderance
  of north temperate, or cosmopolitan forms, with a few which are decidedly tropical. The Pselaphidæ
  and Scydmenidæ, also described by Dr. Sharp, exhibit, according to that gentleman, "even a greater
  resemblance to those of North America than to those of Europe," but he says nothing of any
  tropical affinities. The water-beetles are all either Palæarctic or of wide distribution.</p>

  <p>The Lucanidæ (<i>Gemm. and Har. Cat.</i>, 1868) exhibit an intermingling of Palæarctic and
  Oriental genera.</p>

  <p>The Cetoniidæ (<i>Gemm. and Har. Cat.</i>, 1869) show, for North China and Japan, three
  Oriental to two Palæarctic genera.</p>

  <p>The Buprestidæ collected by Mr. Lewis have been described by Mr. Edward Saunders in the
  <i>Journal of the Linnæan Society</i>, vol. xi. p. 509. The collection consisted of thirty-six
  species belonging to fourteen genera. No less than thirteen of these are known also from India and
  the Malay Islands; nine from Europe; seven from Africa; six from America, and four from China. In
  six of the genera the Japanese species are said to be allied to those of the Oriental region;
  while in three they are allied to European forms, and in two to American. Considering <span
  class="pagenum" id="page230">{230}</span>the southern latitude and warm climate in which these
  insects were mostly collected, and the proximity to Formosa and the Malay Islands compared with
  the enormous distance from Europe, this shows as much Palæarctic affinity as can be expected. In
  the Palæarctic region the group is only plentiful in the southern parts of Europe, which is cut
  off by the cold plateau of Thibet from all direct communication with Japan; while in the Oriental
  region it everywhere abounds and is, in fact, one of the most conspicuous and dominant families of
  Coleoptera.</p>

  <p>The Longicorns collected by Mr. Lewis have been described by Mr. Bates in the <i>Annals of
  Natural History for 1873</i>. The number of species now known from Japan is 107, belonging to
  sixty-four genera. The most important genera are <i>Leptura</i>, <i>Clytanthus</i>,
  <i>Monohammus</i>, <i>Praonetha</i>, <i>Exocentrus</i>, <i>Glenea</i>, and <i>Oberea</i>. There
  are twenty-one tropical genera, and seven peculiar to Japan, leaving thirty-six either Palæarctic
  or of very wide range. A number of the genera are Oriental and Malayan, and many characteristic
  European genera seem to be absent; but it is certain that not half the Japanese Longicorns are yet
  known, and many of these gaps will doubtless be filled up when the more northern islands are
  explored.</p>

  <p>The Phytophaga, described by Mr. Baly, appear to have a considerable preponderance of tropical
  Oriental forms.</p>

  <p>A considerable collection of Hymenoptera formed by Mr. Lewis have been described by Mr.
  Frederick Smith; and exhibit the interesting result, that while the bees and wasps are decidedly
  of tropical and Oriental forms, the Tenthredinidæ and Ichneumonidæ are as decidedly Palæarctic,
  "the general aspect of the collection being that of a European one, only a single exotic form
  being found among them."</p>

  <p><i>Remarks on the General Character of the Fauna of Japan.</i>&mdash;From a general view of the
  phenomena of distribution we feel justified in placing Japan in the Palæarctic region; although
  some tropical groups, especially of reptiles and insects, have largely occupied its southern
  portions; and these same groups have in many cases spread into Northern China, beyond the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page231">{231}</span>usual dividing line of the Palæarctic and Oriental
  regions. The causes of such a phenomenon are not difficult to conceive. Even now, that portion of
  the Palæarctic region between Western Asia and Japan is, for the most part, a bleak and
  inhospitable region, abounding in desert plateaus, and with a rigorous climate even in its most
  favoured districts, and can, therefore, support but a scanty population of snakes, and of such
  groups of insects as require flowers, forests, or a considerable period of warm summer weather;
  and it is precisely these which are represented in Japan and North China by tropical forms. We
  must also consider, that during the Glacial epoch this whole region would have become still less
  productive, and that, as the southern limit of the ice retired northward, it would be followed up
  by many tropical forms along with such as had been driven south by its advance, and had survived
  to return to their northern homes.</p>

  <p>It is also evident that Japan has a more equable and probably moister climate than the opposite
  shores of China, and has also a very different geological character, being rocky and broken, often
  volcanic, and supporting a rich, varied, and peculiar vegetation. It would thus be well adapted to
  support all the more hardy denizens of the tropics which might at various times reach it, while it
  might not be so well adapted for the more boreal forms from Mongolia or Siberia. The fact that a
  mixture of such forms occurs there, is then, little to be wondered at, but we may rather marvel
  that they are not more predominant, and that even in the extreme south, the most abundant forms of
  mammal, bird, and insect, are modifications of familiar Palæarctic types. The fact clearly
  indicates that the former land connections of Japan with the continent have been in a northerly
  rather than in a southerly direction, and that the tropical immigrants have had difficulties to
  contend with, and have found the land already fairly stocked with northern aborigines in almost
  every class and order of animals.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>General Conclusions as to the Fauna of the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;From the
  account that has now been given of the fauna <span class="pagenum" id="page232">{232}</span>of the
  Palæarctic region, it is evident that it owes many of its deficiencies and some of its
  peculiarities to the influence of the Glacial epoch, combined with those important changes of
  physical geography which accompanied or preceded it. The elevation of the old Sarahan sea and the
  complete formation of the Mediterranean, are the most important of these changes in the western
  portion of the region. In the centre, a wide arm of the Arctic Ocean extended southward from the
  Gulf of Obi to the Aral and the Caspian, dividing northern Europe and Asia. At this time our
  European and Siberian sub-regions were probably more distinct than they are now, their complete
  fusion having been effected since the Glacial epoch. As we know that the Himalayas have greatly
  increased in altitude during the Tertiary period, it is not impossible that during the Miocene and
  Pliocene epochs the vast plateau of Central Asia was much less elevated and less completely cut
  off from the influence of rain-bearing winds. It might then have been far more fertile, and have
  supported a rich and varied animal population, a few relics of which we see in the Thibetan
  antelopes, yaks, and wild horses. The influence of yet earlier changes of physical geography, and
  the relations of the Palæarctic to the tropical regions immediately south of it, will be better
  understood when we have examined and discussed the faunas of the Ethiopian and Oriental
  regions.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller"><span class="gsp">THE
  ETHIOPIAN REGION.</span></span></p>

  <p>This is one of the best defined of the great zoological regions, consisting of tropical and
  South Africa, to which must be added tropical Arabia, Madagascar, and a few other islands, all
  popularly known as African. Some naturalists would extend the region northwards to the Atlas
  Mountains and include the whole of the Sahara; but the animal life of the northern part of that
  great desert seems more akin to the Palæarctic fauna of North Africa. The Sahara is really a
  debatable land which has been peopled from both regions; and until we know more of the natural
  history of the great plateaus which rise like islands in the waste of sand, it will be safer to
  make the provisional boundary line at or near the tropic, thus giving the northern half to the
  Palæarctic, the southern to the Ethiopian region. The same line may be continued across
  Arabia.</p>

  <p>With our present imperfect knowledge of the interior of Africa, only three great continental
  sub-regions can be well defined. The open pasture lands of interior tropical Africa are
  wonderfully uniform in their productions; a great number of species ranging from Senegal to
  Abyssinia and thence to the Zambesi, while almost all the commoner African genera extend over the
  whole of this area. Almost all this extensive tract of country is a moderately elevated plateau,
  with a hot and dry climate, and characterised by a grassy vegetation interspersed with patches of
  forest. This forms our first or East African sub-region. The whole of the west coast from the
  south side of the Gambia River to about 10° or 12° south latitude, is a very <span class="pagenum"
  id="page252">{252}</span>different kind of country; being almost wholly dense forests where not
  cleared by man, and having the hot moist uniform climate, and perennial luxuriance of vegetation,
  which characterise the great equatorial belt of forest all round the globe. This forest country
  extends to an unknown distance inland, but it was found, with its features well marked, by Dr.
  Schweinfurth directly he crossed the south-western watershed of the Nile; and far to the south we
  find it again unmistakably indicated, in the excessively moist forest country about the head
  waters of the Congo, where the heroic Livingstone met his death. In this forest district many of
  the more remarkable African types are alone found, and its productions occasionally present us
  with curious similarities to those of the far removed South American or Malayan forests. This is
  our second or West African sub-region.</p>

  <p>Extra-tropical South Africa possesses features of its own, quite distinct from those of both
  the preceding regions (although it has also much in common with the first). Its vegetation is
  known to be one of the richest, most peculiar, and most remarkable on the globe; and in its
  zoology it has a speciality, similar in kind but less in degree, which renders it both natural and
  convenient to separate it as our third, or South African sub-region. Its limits are not very
  clearly ascertained, but it is probably bounded by the Kalahari desert on the north-west, and by
  the Limpopo Valley, or the mountain range beyond, on the north-east, although some of its peculiar
  forms extend to Mozambique. There remains the great Island of Madagascar, one of the most isolated
  and most interesting on the globe, as regards its animal productions; and to this must be added,
  the smaller islands of Bourbon, Mauritius and Rodriguez, the Seychelles and the Comoro Islands,
  forming together the Mascarene Islands,&mdash;the whole constituting our fourth sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Zoological Characteristics of the Ethiopian Region.</i>&mdash;We have now to consider
  briefly, what are the peculiarities and characteristics of the Ethiopian Region as a
  whole,&mdash;those which give it its distinctive features and broadly separate it from the other
  primary zoological regions.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page253">{253}</span></div>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;This region has 9 peculiar families of mammalia. Chiromyidæ (containing
  the aye-aye); Potamogalidæ and Chrysochloridæ (Insectivora); Cryptoproctidæ and Protelidae
  (Carnivora); Hippopotamidæ and Camelopardalidæ (Ungulata); and Orycteropodidæ (Edentata). Besides
  these it possesses 7 peculiar genera of apes, <i>Troglodytes</i>, <i>Colobus</i>,
  <i>Myiopithecus</i>, <i>Cercopithecus</i>, <i>Cercocebus</i>, <i>Theropithecus</i>, and
  <i>Cynocephalus</i>; 2 sub-families of lemurs containing 6 genera, confined to Madagascar, with 3
  genera of two other sub-families confined to the continent; of Insectivora a family, Centetidæ,
  with 5 genera, peculiar to Madagascar, and the genera <i>Petrodromus</i> and <i>Rhynchocyon</i>
  belonging to the Macroscelididæ, or elephant-shrews, restricted to the continent; numerous
  peculiar genera or sub-genera of civets; <i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Megalotis</i>, remarkable genera of
  Canidæ; <i>Ictonyx</i>, the zorilla, a genus allied to the weasels; 13 peculiar genera of Muridæ;
  <i>Pectinator</i>, a genus of the South American family Octodontidæ; and 2 genera of the South
  American Echimyidæ or spiny rats. Of abundant and characteristic groups it possesses
  <i>Macroscelides</i>, <i>Felis</i>, <i>Hyæna</i>, <i>Hyrax</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>, and
  <i>Elephas</i>, as well as several species of zebra and a great variety of antelopes.</p>

  <p>The great speciality indicated by these numerous peculiar families and genera, is still farther
  increased by the absence of certain groups dominant in the Old-World continent, an absence which
  we can only account for by the persistence, through long epochs, of barriers isolating the greater
  part of Africa from the rest of the world. These groups are, Ursidæ, the bears; Talpidæ the moles;
  Camelidæ, the camels; Cervidæ, the deer; Caprinæ, the goats and sheep; and the genera <i>Bos</i>
  (wild ox); and <i>Sus</i> (wild boar). Combining these striking deficiencies, with the no less
  striking peculiarities above enumerated, it seems hardly possible to have a region more sharply
  divided from the rest of the globe than this is, by its whole assemblage of mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;In birds the Ethiopian region is by no means so strikingly peculiar, many
  of these having been able to pass the ancient barriers which so long limited the range of
  mammalia. <span class="pagenum" id="page254">{254}</span>It is, however, sufficiently rich,
  possessing 54 families of land birds, besides a few genera whose position is not well ascertained,
  and which may constitute distinct families. Of these 6 are peculiar, Musophagidæ (the plantain
  eaters); Coliidæ (the colies); Leptosomidæ, allied to the cuckoos; Irrisoridæ, allied to the
  hoopoes; and Serpentaridæ, allied to the hawks. Only one Passerine family is
  peculiar&mdash;Paictidæ, while most of the other tropical regions possess several; but
  <i>Euryceros</i> and <i>Buphaga</i>, here classed with the Sturnidæ, ought, perhaps, to form two
  more. It has, however, many peculiar genera, especially among the fruit-thrushes, Pycnonotidæ;
  flycatchers, Muscicapidæ; shrikes, Lanidæ; crows, Corvidæ; starlings, Sturnidæ; and weaver-birds,
  Ploceidæ; the latter family being very characteristic of the region. It is also rich in barbets,
  Megalæmidæ (7 peculiar genera); cuckoos, Cuculidæ; rollers, Coraciidæ; bee-eaters, Meropidæ;
  hornbills, Bucerotidæ; and goat-suckers, Caprimulgidæ. It is poor in parrots and rather so in
  pigeons; but it abounds in <i>Pterocles</i> and <i>Francolinus</i>, genera of Gallinæ, and
  possesses 4 genera of the peculiar group of the guinea-fowls, forming part of the pheasant family.
  It abounds in vultures, eagles, and other birds of prey, among which is the anomalous genus
  <i>Serpentarius</i>, the secretary-bird, constituting a distinct family. Many of the most
  remarkable forms are confined to Madagascar and the adjacent islands, and will be noticed in our
  account of that sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Of the reptiles there are 4 peculiar Ethiopian families;&mdash;3 of
  snakes, Rachiodontidæ, Dendraspidæ, and Atractaspidæ and 1 of lizards, Chamæsauridæ.</p>

  <p>Psammophidæ (desert snakes) are abundant, as are Lycodontidæ (fanged ground-snakes), and
  Viperidæ (vipers). The following genera of snakes are peculiar or highly
  characteristic:&mdash;<i>Leptorhynchus</i>, <i>Rhamnophis</i>, <i>Herpetethiops</i> and
  <i>Grayia</i> (Colubridæ); <i>Hopsidrophis</i> and <i>Bucephalus</i> (Dendrophidæ);
  <i>Langalia</i> (Dryophidæ); <i>Pythonodipsas</i> (Dipsadidæ); <i>Boedon</i>, <i>Lycophidion</i>,
  <i>Holuropholis</i>, <i>Simocephalus</i> and <i>Lamprophis</i> (Lycodontidæ); <i>Hortulia</i> and
  <i>Sanzinia</i> (Pythonidæ); <i>Cyrptophis</i>, <i>Elapsoidea</i> and <i>P&#x0153;cilophis</i>
  (Elapidæ); and <i>Atheris</i> (Viperidæ). The following genera <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255">{255}</span>of lizards are the most characteristic:&mdash;<i>Monotrophis</i>
  (Lepidosternidæ); <i>Cordylus</i>, <i>Pseudocordylus</i>, <i>Platysaurus</i>,
  <i>Cordylosaurus</i>, <i>Pleurostichus</i>, <i>Saurophis</i> and <i>Zonurus</i> (Zonuridæ);
  <i>Sphænops</i>, <i>Scelotes</i>, <i>Sphænocephalus</i> and <i>Sepsina</i> (Sepidæ);
  <i>Pachydactylus</i> (Geckotidæ); <i>Agama</i> (Agamidæ); and <i>Chameleon</i> (Chameleonidæ). Of
  tortoises, <i>Cynyxis</i>, <i>Pyxis</i> and <i>Chersina</i> (Testudinidæ), and <i>Cycloderma</i>
  (Trionychidæ) are the most characteristic.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Of the 9 families of amphibia there is only 1 peculiar, the
  Dactylethridæ, a group of toads; but the Alytidæ, a family of frogs, are abundant.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fish.</i>&mdash;Of the 14 families of fresh-water fishes 3 are peculiar:
  Mormyridæ and Gymnarchidæ, small groups not far removed from the pikes; and Polypteridæ, a small
  group of ganoid fishes allied to the gar-pikes (Lepidosteidæ) of North America.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of Ethiopian Vertebrates.</i>&mdash;Combining the results here indicated and set
  forth in greater detail in the tables of distribution, we find that the Ethiopian region possesses
  examples of 44 families of mammalia, 72 of birds, 35 of reptiles, 9 of amphibia, and 15 of
  fresh-water fishes. It has 23 (or perhaps 25) families of Vertebrata altogether peculiar to it out
  of a total of 175 families, or almost exactly one-eighth of the whole. Out of 142 genera of
  mammalia found within the region, 90 are peculiar to it; a proportion not much short of
  two-thirds. Of land birds there are 294 genera, of which 179 are peculiar; giving a proportion of
  a little less than three-fifths.</p>

  <p>Compared with the Oriental region this shows a considerably larger amount of speciality under
  all the heads; but the superiority is mainly due to the wonderful and isolated fauna of
  Madagascar, to which the Oriental region has nothing comparable. Without this the regions would be
  nearly equal.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Insects: Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;11 out of the 16 families of butterflies have
  representatives in Africa, but none are peculiar. Acræidæ is one of the most characteristic
  families, and there <span class="pagenum" id="page256">{256}</span>are many interesting forms of
  Nymphalidæ, Lycænidæ, and Papilionidæ. The peculiar or characteristic forms are <i>Amauris</i>
  (Danaidæ); <i>Gnophodes</i>, <i>Leptoneura</i>, <i>Bicyclus</i>, <i>Heteropsis</i> and
  <i>C&#x0153;nyra</i> (Satyridæ); <i>Acræa</i> (Acræidæ); <i>Lachnoptera</i>, <i>Precis</i>,
  <i>Salamis</i>, <i>Crenis</i>, <i>Godartia</i>, <i>Amphidema</i>, <i>Pseudacræa</i>,
  <i>Catuna</i>, <i>Euryphene</i>, <i>Romalæosoma</i>, <i>Hamanumida</i>, <i>Aterica</i>,
  <i>Harma</i>, <i>Meneris</i>, <i>Charaxes</i>, and <i>Philognoma</i> (Nymphalidæ); <i>Pentila</i>,
  <i>Liptena</i>, <i>Durbania</i>, <i>Zeritis</i>, <i>Capys</i>, <i>Phytala</i>, <i>Epitola</i>,
  <i>Hewitsonia</i> and <i>Deloneura</i> (Lycænidæ); <i>Pseudopontia</i>, <i>Idmais</i>,
  <i>Teracolus</i>, <i>Callosune</i> (Pieridæ); <i>Abantis</i>, <i>Ceratrichia</i> and
  <i>Caprona</i> (Hesperidæ). The total number of species known is about 750; which is very poor for
  an extensive tropical region, but this is not to be wondered at when the nature of much of the
  country is considered. It is also, no doubt, partly due to our comparative ignorance of the great
  equatorial forest district, which is the only part likely to be very productive in this order of
  insects.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;In our first representative family, Cicindelidæ or tiger-beetles, the
  Ethiopian region is rather rich, having 13 genera, 11 of which are peculiar to it; and among these
  are such remarkable forms as <i>Manticora</i>, <i>Myrmecoptera</i> and <i>Dromica</i>; with
  <i>Megacephala</i>, a genus only found elsewhere in Australia and South America.</p>

  <p>In Carabidæ or carnivorous ground beetles, there are about 75 peculiar genera. Among the most
  characteristic are <i>Anthia</i>, <i>Polyrhina</i>, <i>Graphipterus</i> and <i>Piezia</i>, which
  are almost all peculiar; while <i>Orthogonius</i>, <i>Hexagonia</i>, <i>Macrochilus</i>,
  <i>Thyreopterus</i>, <i>Eudema</i>, and <i>Abacetus</i> are common to this and the Oriental
  region; and <i>Hypolithus</i> to the Neotropical.</p>

  <p>Out of 27 genera of Buprestidæ, or metallic beetles, only 6 are peculiar to the region, one of
  the most remarkable being <i>Polybothrus</i>, confined to Madagascar. <i>Sternocera</i> and
  <i>Chrysochroa</i> are characteristic of this region and the Oriental; it has <i>Julodis</i> in
  common with the Mediterranean sub-region, and <i>Belionota</i> with the Malayan.</p>

  <p>The region is not rich in Lucanidæ, or stag-beetles, possessing only 10 genera, 7 of which are
  peculiar, but most of them <span class="pagenum" id="page257">{257}</span>consist of single
  species. The other three genera, <i>Cladognathus</i>, <i>Nigidius</i>, and <i>Figulus</i>, are the
  most characteristic, though all have a tolerably wide range in the Old World.</p>

  <p>In the elegant Cetoniidæ, or rose-chafers, this region stands preeminent, possessing 76 genera,
  64 of which are peculiar to it. The others are chiefly Oriental, except <i>Oxythræa</i> which is
  European, and <i>Stethodesma</i> which is Neotropical. Preeminent in size and beauty is
  <i>Goliathus</i>, comprising perhaps the most bulky of all highly-coloured beetles. Other large
  and characteristic genera are <i>Ceratorhina</i>, <i>Ischnostoma</i>, <i>Anochilia</i>,
  <i>Diplognatha</i>, <i>Agenius</i>, and many others of less extent.</p>

  <p>In the enormous tribe of Longicorns, or long-horned beetles, the Ethiopian is not so rich as
  the other three tropical regions; but this may be, in great part, owing to its more productive
  districts having never been explored by any competent entomologists. It nevertheless possesses 262
  genera, 216 of which are peculiar, the others being mostly groups of very wide range. Out of such
  a large number it is difficult to select a few as most characteristic, but some of the
  peculiarities of distribution as regards other regions may be named. Among Prionidæ,
  <i>Tithoes</i> is a characteristic Ethiopian genus. A few species of the American genera
  <i>Parandra</i> and <i>Mallodon</i> occur here, while the North Temperate genus <i>Prionus</i> is
  only found in Madagascar. Among Cerambycidæ, <i>Promeces</i> is the most characteristic. The
  American genera <i>Oeme</i> and <i>Cyrtomerus</i> occur; while <i>Homalachnus</i> and
  <i>Philagathes</i> are Malayan, and <i>Leptocera</i> occurs only in Madagascar, Ceylon,
  Austro-Malaya, and Australia. The Lamiidæ are very fine; <i>Sternotomis</i>, <i>Tragocephala</i>,
  <i>Ceroplesis</i>, <i>Phryncta</i>, <i>Volumnia</i>, and <i>Nitocris</i>, being very abundant and
  characteristic. Most of the non-peculiar genera of this family are Oriental, but
  <i>Spalacopsis</i> and <i>Acanthoderes</i> are American, while <i>Tetraglenes</i> and
  <i>Sch&#x0153;nionta</i> have been found only in East and South Africa and in Malaya.</p>

  <p><i>Terrestrial Mollusca</i>.&mdash;In the extensive family of the Helicidæ or snails, 13 genera
  are represented, only one of which, <i>Columna</i>, is peculiar. This region is however the
  metropolis of <i>Achatina</i>, some of the species being the largest land-shells <span
  class="pagenum" id="page258">{258}</span>known. <i>Buliminus</i>, <i>Stenogyra</i>, and
  <i>Pupa</i> are characteristic genera. <i>Bulimus</i> is absent, though one species inhabits St.
  Helena. The operculated shells are not very well represented, the great family of Cyclostomidæ
  having here only nine genera, with but one peculiar, <i>Lithidion</i>, found in Madagascar,
  Socotra, and Arabia. None of the genera appear to be well represented throughout the region, and
  they are almost or quite absent from West Africa.</p>

  <p class="sp3">According to Woodward's <i>Manual</i> (1868) West Africa has about 200 species of
  land-shells, South Africa about 100, Madagascar nearly 100, Mauritius about 50. All the islands
  have their peculiar species; and are, in proportion to their extent, much richer than the
  continent; as is usually the case.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Ethiopian Sub-regions.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">It has been already explained that these are to some extent provisional; yet it is
  believed that they represent generally the primary natural divisions of the region, however they
  may be subdivided when our knowledge of their productions becomes more accurate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>I. The East African Sub-region, or Central and East Africa.</i></p>

  <p>This division includes all the open country of tropical Africa south of the Sahara, as well as
  an undefined southern margin of that great desert. With the exception of a narrow strip along the
  east coast and the valleys of the Niger and Nile, it is a vast elevated plateau from 1,000 to
  4,000 feet high, hilly rather than mountainous, except the lofty table land of Abyssinia, with
  mountains rising to 16,000 feet and extending south to the equator, where it terminates in the
  peaks of Kenia and Kilimandjaro, 18,000 and 20,000 feet high. The northern portion of this
  sub-region is a belt about 300 miles wide between the Sahara on the north and the great equatorial
  forest on the south, extending from Cape Verd, the extreme western point of Africa, across the
  northern bend of the Niger and Lake Tchad to the mountains of Abyssinia. The greater part of this
  tract has a <span class="pagenum" id="page259">{259}</span>moderate elevation. The eastern portion
  reaches from about the second cataract of the Nile, or perhaps from about the parallel of 20° N.
  Latitude, down to about 20° S. Latitude, and from the east coast to where the great forest region
  commences, or to Lake Tanganyika and about the meridian of 28° to 30° E. Longitude. The greater
  part of this tract is a lofty plateau.</p>

  <p>The surface of all this sub-region is generally open, covered with a vegetation of high grasses
  or thorny shrubs, with scattered trees and isolated patches of forest in favourable situations.
  The only parts where extensive continuous forests occur, are on the eastern and western slopes of
  the great Abyssinian plateau, and on the Mozambique coast from Zanzibar to Sofala. The whole of
  this great district has one general zoological character. Many species range from Senegal to
  Abyssinia, others from Abyssinia to the Zambesi, and a few, as <i>Mungos fasciatus</i> and
  <i>Phacoch&#x0153;rus æthiopicus</i>, range over the entire sub-region. <i>Fennecus</i>,
  <i>Ictonyx</i>, and several genera of antelopes, characterise every part of it, as do many genera
  of birds. <i>Coracias nævia</i>, <i>Corythornis cyanostigma</i>, <i>Tockus nasutus</i>, <i>T.
  erythrorhynchus</i>, <i>Parus leucopterus</i>, <i>Buphaga africana</i>, <i>Vidua paradisea</i>,
  are examples of <i>species</i>, which are found in the Gambia, Abyssinia and South East Africa,
  but not in the West African sub-region; and considering how very little is known of the natural
  history of the country immediately south of the Sahara, it may well be supposed that these are
  only a small portion of the species really common to the whole area in question, and which prove
  its fundamental unity.</p>

  <p>Although this sub-region is so extensive and so generally uniform in physical features, it is
  by far the least peculiar part of Africa. It possesses, of course, all those wide-spread Ethiopian
  types which inhabit every part of the region, but it has hardly any special features of its own.
  The few genera which are peculiar to it have generally a limited range, and for the most part
  belong, either to the isolated mountain-plateau of Abyssinia which is almost as much Palæarctic as
  Ethiopian, or to the woody districts of Mozambique where the fauna has more of a West or South
  African character.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page260">{260}</span></div>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The only forms of Mammalia peculiar to this sub-region are
  <i>Theropithecus</i>, one of the Cynopithecidæ confined to Abyssinia; <i>Petrodromus</i> and
  <i>Rhynchocyon</i>, belonging to the insectivorous Macroscelididæ, have only been found in
  Mozambique; the Antelopine genus <i>Neotragus</i>, from Abyssinia southward; <i>Saccostomus</i>
  and <i>Pelomys</i> genera of Muridæ inhabiting Mozambique; <i>Heterocephalus</i> from Abyssinia,
  and <i>Heliophobius</i> from Mozambique, belonging to the Spalacidæ; and <i>Pectinator</i> from
  Abyssinia, belonging to the Octodontidæ. <i>Cynocephalus</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>,
  <i>Camelopardalis</i>, and antelopes of the genera <i>Oryx</i>, <i>Cervicapra</i>, <i>Kobus</i>,
  <i>Nanotragus</i>, <i>Cephalophus</i>, <i>Hippotragus</i>, <i>Alcephalus</i>, and
  <i>Catoblepas</i>, are characteristic; as well as <i>Felis</i>, <i>Hyæna</i>, and numerous civets
  and ichneumons.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Peculiar forms of birds are hardly to be found here; we only meet with
  two&mdash;<i>Hypocolius</i>, a genus of shrikes in Abyssinia; and <i>Balæniceps</i>, the great
  boat-billed heron of the Upper Nile. Yet throughout the country birds are abundant, and most of
  the typical Ethiopian forms are well represented.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Of reptiles, the only peculiar forms recorded are <i>Xenocalamus</i>, a
  genus of snakes, belonging to the Calamariidæ; and <i>Pythonodipsas</i>, one of the Dipsadidæ,
  both from the Zambesi; and among lizards, <i>Pisturus</i>, one of the Geckotidæ, from
  Abyssinia.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia and Fishes.</i>&mdash;There are no peculiar forms of amphibia or of fresh-water
  fishes.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Insects are almost equally unproductive of peculiar forms. Among
  butterflies we have <i>Abantis</i>, one of the Hesperidæ, from Mozambique; and in Coleoptera, 2
  genera of Cicindelidæ, 8 of Carabidæ, 1 or 2 of Cetoniidæ, and about half-a-dozen of Longicorns: a
  mere nothing, as we shall see, compared with the hosts of peculiar genera that characterise each
  of the other sub-regions. Neither do land-shells appear to present any peculiar forms.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The fact that so very few special types characterise the extensive area now under
  consideration is very noteworthy. It justifies us in uniting this large and widespread tract of
  country as forming essentially but one sub-division of the great Ethiopian region, and it suggests
  some curious speculations as to the former history of that region, a subject which must be
  deferred to the latter part of this chapter. In none of the other great tropical regions does it
  occur, that the largest portion of their area, although swarming with life, yet possesses hardly
  any distinctive features except the absence of numerous types characteristic of the other
  sub-regions.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Plate IV.</i>&mdash;<i>Illustrating the Zoology of East
  Africa.</i>&mdash;Although this sub-region has so little speciality, it is that which abounds most
  in large animals, and is, perhaps, the best representative of Africa as regards zoology. Some of
  the most distinctive of African animals range over the whole of it, and as, from recent
  explorations, many parts of this wide area have been made known to the reading public, we devote
  one of our plates to illustrate the especially African forms of life that here abound. The
  antelopes represented are the koodoo (<i>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</i>) one of the handsomest of
  the family, which ranges over all the highlands of Africa from Abyssinia to the southern
  districts. To the left is the aardvark, or earth pig, of North Eastern Africa (<i>Orycteropus
  æthiopicus</i>) which, to the north of the equator in East Africa, represents the allied species
  of the Cape of Good Hope. These Edentata are probably remnants of the ancient fauna of Africa,
  when it was completely isolated from the northern continents and few of the higher types had been
  introduced. The large bird in the foreground is the secretary-bird, or serpent-killer
  (<i>Serpentarius reptilivorus</i>), which has affinities both for the birds-of-prey and the
  waders. It is common over almost all the open country of Africa, destroying and feeding on the
  most venomous serpents. The bird on the wing is the red-billed promerops (<i>Irrisor
  erythrorhynchus</i>), a handsome bird with glossy plumage and coral-red bill. It is allied to the
  hoopoes, and feeds on insects which it hunts for among the branches of trees. This species also
  ranges over a large part of east and central Africa to near the Cape of Good Hope. Other species
  are found in the west; and the genus, which forms a distinct family, <i>Irrisoridæ</i>, is one of
  the best marked Ethiopian types of birds. In the distance is a rhinoceros, now one of the
  characteristic features of African <span class="pagenum" id="page262">{262}</span>zoology, though
  there is reason to believe that it is a comparatively recent intruder into the country.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>II. The West-African Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This may be defined as the equatorial-forest sub-region, since it comprises all that portion of
  Africa, from the west coast inland, over which the great equatorial forests prevail more or less
  uninterruptedly. These commence to the south of the Gambia River, and extend eastwards in a line
  roughly parallel to the southern margin of the great desert, as far as the sources of the upper
  Nile and the mountains forming the western boundary of the basin of the great lakes; and southward
  to that high but marshy forest-country in which Livingstone was travelling at the time of his
  death. Its southern limits are undetermined, but are probably somewhere about the parallel of 11°
  S. Latitude.<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This extensive and luxuriant district has only been explored zoologically in the neighbourhood
  of the West coast. Much, no doubt, remains to be done in the interior, yet its main features are
  sufficiently well known, and most of its characteristic types of animal life have, no doubt, been
  discovered.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Several very important groups of mammals are peculiar to this
  sub-region. Most prominent are the great anthropoid apes&mdash;the gorilla and the
  chimpanzee&mdash;forming the genus <i>Troglodytes</i>; and monkeys of the genera
  <i>Myiopithecus</i> and <i>Cercocebus</i>. Two remarkable forms of lemurs, <i>Perodicticus</i> and
  <i>Arctocebus</i>, are also peculiar to West Africa. Among the Insectivora is <i>Potamogale</i>, a
  semi-aquatic animal, forming a distinct family; and three peculiar genera of civets (Viverridæ)
  have been described. <i>Hyomoschus</i>, a small, deer-like animal, belongs to the Tragulidæ, or
  chevrotains, a family otherwise <span class="pagenum" id="page263">{263}</span>confined to the
  Oriental region; and in the squirrel family is a curious genus, <i>Anomalurus</i>, which resembles
  the flying squirrels of other parts of the world, without being directly allied to them.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;In this class we find a larger proportionate number of peculiar forms.
  <i>Hypergerus</i> and <i>Alethe</i>, belonging to the Timaliidæ, or babblers, are perhaps allied
  to Malayan groups; <i>Parinia</i>, a peculiar form of tit, is found only in Prince's Island;
  <i>Ixonotus</i> is an abundant and characteristic form of Pycnonotidæ; <i>Fraseria</i>,
  <i>Hypodes</i>, <i>Cuphopterus</i>, and <i>Chaunonotus</i>, are peculiar genera of shrikes;
  <i>Picathartes</i> is one of the many strange forms of the crow family; <i>Cinnyricinclus</i> is a
  peculiar genus of sun-birds; <i>Pholidornis</i> is supposed to belong to the Oriental Dicæidæ, or
  flower-peckers; <i>Waldenia</i> is a recently-described new form of swallow; <i>Ligurnus</i>, a
  finch, <i>Spermospiga</i>, a weaver bird, and <i>Onychognathus</i> a starling, are also peculiar
  West African genera. Coming to the Picariæ we have <i>Verreauxia</i>, a peculiar woodpecker; three
  peculiar genera of barbets (Megalæmidæ); the typical plantain-eaters (Musophaga); <i>Myioceyx</i>,
  a peculiar genus of kingfishers; while <i>Berenicornis</i> is a genus of crested hornbills, only
  found elsewhere in Malaya. The grey parrots, of the genus <i>Psittacus</i>, are confined to this
  sub-region, as are two peculiar genera of partridges, and three of guinea-fowl. We have also here
  a species of <i>Pitta</i>, one of the Oriental family of ground-thrushes; and the Oriental
  paroquets, <i>Palæornis</i>, are found here as well as in Abyssinia and the Mascarene Islands.</p>

  <p>We thus find, both in the Mammalia and birds of West Africa, a special Oriental or even Malayan
  element not present in the other parts of tropical Africa, although appearing again in Madagascar.
  In the Mammalia it is represented by the anthropoid apes; by <i>Colobus</i> allied to
  <i>Semnopithecus</i>, and by <i>Cercocebus</i> allied to <i>Macacus</i>; and especially by a form
  of the Malayan family of chevrotains (Tragulidæ). The Malayan genus of otters, <i>Aonyx</i>, is
  also said to occur in West and South Africa. In birds we have special Oriental and Malayan
  affinities in <i>Alethe</i>, <i>Pholidornis</i>, <i>Berenicornis</i>, <i>Pitta</i>, and
  <i>Palæornis;</i> while the Oriental genus <i>Treron</i> has a wide range in Africa. We shall
  <span class="pagenum" id="page264">{264}</span>endeavour to ascertain the meaning of this special
  relation at a subsequent stage of our inquiries.</p>

  <p><i>Plate V.</i>&mdash;<i>River Scene in West Africa, with Characteristic Animals.</i>&mdash;Our
  artist has here well represented the luxuriance and beauty of a tropical forest; and the whole
  scene is such as might be witnessed on the banks of one of the rivers of equatorial West Africa.
  On the right we see a red river-hog (<i>Potamoch&#x0153;rus penicillatus</i>), one of the
  handsomest of the swine family, and highly characteristic of the West African sub-region. In a
  tree overhead is the potto (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>), one of the curious forms of lemur confined
  to West Africa. On the left is the remarkable <i>Potamogale velox</i>, first discovered by Du
  Chaillu,&mdash;an Insectivorous animal, with the form and habits of an otter. On the other side of
  the river are seen a pair of gorillas (<i>Troglodytes gorilla</i>), the largest of the anthropoid
  apes.</p>

  <p>The bird on the wing is the Whydah finch (<i>Vidua paradisea</i>), remarkable for the enormous
  plumes with which the tail of the male bird is decorated during the breeding season. The crested
  bird overhead is one of the beautiful green touracos (<i>Turacus macrorhynchus</i>), belonging to
  the Musophagidæ, or plantain-eaters, a family wholly African, and most abundant in the western
  sub-region.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;In this class we find a large number of peculiar forms; 13 genera of
  snakes, 3 of lizards, and 2 of tortoises being confined to the sub-region. The snakes are
  <i>Pariaspis</i>, <i>Elapops</i>, and <i>Prosymna</i> (Calamariidæ), <i>Rhamnophis</i>,
  <i>Herpetethiops</i>, and <i>Grayia</i> (Colubridæ), <i>Neusterophis</i> and <i>Limnophis</i>
  (Homalopsidæ), <i>Simocephalus</i> and <i>Holurophis</i> (Lycodontidæ); <i>Pelophilus</i>
  (Pythonidæ); <i>Elapsoidea</i> (Elapidæ); and <i>Atheris</i> (Viperidæ). The lizards are
  <i>Dalophia</i> (Lepidosternidæ); <i>Otosaurus</i> (Scincidæ); <i>Psilodactylus</i> (Geckotidæ).
  The tortoises, <i>Cinyxis</i> (Testudinidæ) and <i>Tetrathyra</i> (Trionichidæ).</p>

  <p class="sp4"><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Of Amphibia, there are 2 peculiar genera of tree-frogs,
  <i>Hylambatis</i> and <i>Hemimantis</i>, belonging to the Polypedatidæ.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="fine">Plate V.</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page265">{265}</span></div>

  <p>Here, too, we find some interesting relations with the Oriental region on the one side, and the
  Neotropical on the other. The snakes of the family Homalopsidæ have a wide range, in America,
  Europe, and all over the Oriental region, but are confined to West Africa in the Ethiopian region.
  <i>Dryiophis</i> (Dryiophidæ) and <i>Dipsadoboa</i> (Dipsadidæ) on the other hand, are genera of
  tropical America which occur also in West Africa. The family of lizards, Acontiadæ, are found in
  West and South Africa, Ceylon, and the Moluccas. The family of toads, Engystomidæ, in West and
  South Africa and the whole Oriental region; while the Phryniscidæ inhabit tropical Africa and
  Java.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;We have here a large number of peculiar genera. There are 10 of
  butterflies, <i>Lachnoptera</i>, <i>Amphidema</i>, and <i>Catuna</i> belonging to the Nymphalidæ,
  while four others are Lycænidæ. The genus <i>Euxanthe</i> is common to West Africa and
  Madagascar.</p>

  <p>Of Coleoptera there are 53 peculiar genera; 20 are Carabidæ, 2 Lucanidæ, 12 Cetoniidæ, 3
  Prionidæ, 16 Cerambycidæ, and 34 Lamiidæ. Besides these there are 4 or 5 genera confined to West
  Africa and Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>Land Shells.</i>&mdash;West Africa is very rich in land shells, but it does not appear to
  possess any well-marked genera, although several of the smaller groups or sub-genera are confined
  to it. Helicidæ of the genera <i>Nanina</i>, <i>Buliminus</i> and <i>Achatina</i> are abundant and
  characteristic.</p>

  <p><i>Islands of the West African Sub-region.</i>&mdash;The islands in the Gulf of Guinea are,
  Fernando Po, very near the main land, with Prince's Island and St. Thomas, considerably further
  away to the south-west. Fernando Po was once thought to be a remarkable instance of an island
  possessing a very peculiar fauna, although close to the main land and not divided from it by a
  deep sea. This, however, was due to our having obtained considerable collections from Fernando Po,
  while the opposite coast was almost unknown. One after another the species supposed to be peculiar
  have been found on the continent, till it becomes probable, that, as in the case of other islands
  similarly situated, it contains no peculiar species whatever. The presence of numerous mammalia,
  among which are baboons, lemurs, <i>Hyrax</i>, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page266">{266}</span><i>Anomalurus</i>, shows that this island has probably once been united
  to the continent.</p>

  <p>Prince's Island, situated about 100 miles from the coast, has no mammals, but between 30 and 40
  species of birds. Of these 7 are peculiar species, viz., <i>Zosterops ficedulina</i>,
  <i>Cuphopterus dohrni</i> (a peculiar genus of Sylviidæ), <i>Symplectes princeps</i>, <i>Crithagra
  rufilata</i>, <i>Columba chlorophæa</i>, <i>Peristera principalis</i>, and <i>Strix
  thomensis</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the Island of St. Thomas, situated on the equator about 150 miles from the
  coast, there are 6 peculiar species out of 30 known birds, viz., <i>Scops leucopsis</i>,
  <i>Zosterops lugubris</i>, <i>Turdus olivaceofuscus</i>, <i>Oriolus crassirostris</i>,
  <i>Symplectes sancti-thomæ</i> and <i>Aplopelia simplex</i>; also <i>Strix thomensis</i> in common
  with Prince's Island. The remainder are all found on the adjacent coasts. It is remarkable that in
  Prince's Island there are no birds of prey, any that appear being driven off by the parrots
  (<i>Psittacus erithacus</i>) that abound there; whereas in St. Thomas and Fernando Po they are
  plentiful.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>III. South-African Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This is the most peculiar and interesting part of Africa, but owing to the absence of existing
  barriers its limits cannot be well defined. The typical portion of it hardly contains more than
  the narrow strip of territory limited by the mountain range which forms the boundary of the Cape
  Colony and Natal, while in a wider sense it may be extended to include Mozambique. It may perhaps
  be best characterised as bounded by the Kalahari desert and the Limpopo river. It is in the more
  limited district of the extreme south, that the wonderful Cape flora alone exists. Here are more
  genera and species, and more peculiar types of plants congregated together, than in any other part
  of the globe of equal extent. There are indications of a somewhat similar richness and
  specialization in the zoology of this country; but animals are so much less closely dependent on
  soil and climate, that much of the original peculiarity has been obliterated, by long continued
  interchange of species with so vast an area as <span class="pagenum" id="page267">{267}</span>that
  of Africa south of the equator. The extreme peculiarity and isolation of the flora must not,
  however, be lost sight of, if we would correctly interpret the phenomena afforded by the
  distribution of animal life on the African continent.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;A much larger number of peculiar forms of mammals are found here than in
  any of the other sub-regions, although it is far less in extent than either of the three divisions
  of the continent. Among Insectivora we have the Chrysochloridæ, or golden moles, consisting of two
  genera confined to South Africa; while the Macroscelididæ, or elephant shrews, are also
  characteristically South African, although ranging as far as Mozambique and the Zambezi, with one
  outlying species in North Africa. The Viverridæ are represented by three peculiar genera,
  <i>Ariela</i>, <i>Cynictis</i>, and <i>Suricata</i>. The Carnivora present some remarkable forms:
  <i>Proteles</i>, forming a distinct family allied to the hyænas and weasels; and two curious forms
  of Canidæ&mdash;<i>Megalotis</i> (the long-eared fox) and <i>Lycaon</i> (the hyæna-dog), the
  latter found also in parts of East Africa. <i>Hydrogale</i> is a peculiar form of Mustelidæ;
  <i>Pelea</i> one of the antelopes; <i>Dendromys</i>, <i>Malacothrix</i>, and <i>Mystromys</i> are
  peculiar genera of the mouse family (Muridæ); <i>Bathyerges</i> one of the mole-rats (Spalacidæ);
  <i>Pedetes</i>, the Cape-hare, a remarkable form of jerboa; and <i>Petromys</i>, one of the
  spiny-rats (Echimyidæ). The remarkable <i>Orycteropus</i>, or earth-pig, has one species in South
  and one in North East Africa. We have thus eighteen genera of mammalia almost or quite peculiar to
  South Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;These do not present so many peculiar forms, yet some are very remarkable.
  <i>Chætops</i> is an isolated genus of thrushes (Turdidæ). <i>Lioptilus</i>, one of the
  fruit-thrushes (Pycnonotidæ). <i>Pogonocichla</i>, one of the fly-catchers; <i>Urolestes</i>, a
  shrike; <i>Promerops</i>, a sun-bird; <i>Philetærus</i> and <i>Chera</i>, weaver-birds; and three
  peculiar genera of larks&mdash;<i>Spizocorys</i>, <i>Heterocorys</i>, and <i>Tephrocorys</i>,
  complete the list of peculiar types of Passeres. A wood-pecker, <i>Geocolaptes</i>, is nearly
  allied to a South American genus. The Cape-dove, <i>&#x0152;na</i>, is confined to South and East
  Africa and Madagascar; and <i>Thalassornis</i> is a peculiar form of duck. Several genera are also
  confined to West and South <span class="pagenum" id="page268">{268}</span>Africa;&mdash;as
  <i>Phyllastrephus</i> (Pycnonotidæ), <i>Smithornis</i> (Muscicapidæ), <i>Corvinella</i> (Laniidæ);
  <i>Barbatula</i> and <i>Xylobucco</i> (Megalæmidæ); <i>Ceuthmochares</i>, also in Madagascar,
  (Cuculidæ); <i>Typanistria</i> (Columbidæ). Other remarkable forms, though widely spread over
  Africa, appear to have their metropolis here, as <i>Colius</i> and <i>Indicator</i>. Others seem
  to be confined to South Africa and Abyssinia, as the curious <i>Buphaga</i> (Sturnidæ); and
  <i>Apaloderma</i> (Trogonidæ). <i>Machærhamphus</i> (Falconidæ) is found only in South-West
  Africa, Madagascar, and the Malay Peninsula.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;There are 4 peculiar genera of snakes,&mdash;<i>Typhline</i>, belonging
  to the blind burrowing snakes, Typhlopidæ; <i>Lamprophis</i> (Lycodontidæ); <i>Cyrtophis</i> and
  <i>Pæcilophis</i> (Elapidæ), a family which is chiefly Oriental and Australian. Of Lizards there
  are 10 peculiar genera; <i>Monotrophis</i> (Lepidosternidæ), but with an allied form in Angola;
  <i>Cordylus</i>, <i>Pseudocordylus</i>, <i>Platysaurus</i>, <i>Cordylosaurus</i>,
  <i>Pleurostichus</i>, and <i>Saurophis</i>, all peculiar genera of Zonuridæ; <i>Chamæsaura</i>,
  forming the peculiar family Chamæsauridæ; <i>Colopus</i> and <i>Rhopitropus</i> (Geckotidæ).</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Of Amphibia there are 4 peculiar genera: <i>Schismaderma</i> (Bufonidæ);
  <i>Brachymerus</i> (Engystomidæ); <i>Phrynobatrachus</i> and <i>Stenorhynchus</i> (Ranidæ). These
  last are allied to Oriental genera, and the only other Engystomidæ are Oriental and
  Neotropical.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fish.</i>&mdash;Of fresh-water fishes there is 1
  genus&mdash;<i>Abrostomus</i>&mdash;belonging to the carp family, peculiar to South Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;South Africa is excessively rich in insects, and the number of peculiar
  types surpasses that of any other part of the region. We can only here summarize the results.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;Of butterflies there are 7 peculiar genera; 2 belonging to the
  Satyridæ, 1 to Acræidæ, 3 to Lycænidæ, and 1 to Hesperidæ. <i>Zeritis</i> (Lycænidæ) is also
  characteristic of this sub-region, although 1 species occurs in West Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;These are very remarkable. In the family of Cicindelidæ, or
  tiger-beetles, we have the extraordinary <i>Manticora</i> and <i>Platychile</i>, forming a
  sub-family, whose nearest allies are in North America; as well as <i>Ophryodera</i> and
  <i>Dromica</i>, the latter an extensive genus, which ranges as far north as Mozambique <span
  class="pagenum" id="page269">{269}</span>and Lake Ngami. Another genus of this family,
  <i>Jansenia</i>, is common to South Africa and South India.</p>

  <p>In the large family of Carabidæ, or ground-beetles, there are 17 peculiar South African genera,
  the most important being <i>Crepidogaster</i>, <i>Hytrichopus</i>, <i>Arsinoë</i>, and
  <i>Piezia</i>. Three others&mdash;<i>Eunostus</i>, <i>Glyphodactyla</i>, and
  <i>Megalonychus</i>&mdash;are common to South Africa and Madagascar only. There is also a genus in
  common with Java, and one with Australia.</p>

  <p>Of Lucanidæ, or stag-beetles, there are 3 peculiar genera; of Cetoniidæ, or rose-chafers, 14;
  and of Buprestidæ, 2.</p>

  <p>In the great family of Longicorns there are no less than 67 peculiar genera&mdash;an immense
  number when we consider that the generally open character of the country, is such as is not
  usually well suited to this group of insects. They consist of 5 peculiar genera of Prionidæ, 25 of
  Cerambycidæ, and 37 of Lamiidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of South-African Zoology.</i>&mdash;Summarizing these results, we find that South
  Africa possesses 18 peculiar genera of Mammalia, 12 of Birds, 18 of Reptiles, 1 of Fishes, 7 of
  Butterflies, and 107 of the six typical families of Coleoptera. Besides this large amount of
  speciality it contains many other groups, which extend either to West Africa, to Abyssinia, or to
  Madagascar only, a number of which are no doubt to be referred as originating here. We also find
  many cases of direct affinity with the Oriental region, and especially with the Malay districts,
  and others with Australia; and there are also less marked indications of a relation to
  America.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Atlantic Islands of the Ethiopian Region.</i> <i>St. Helena.</i>&mdash;The position of St.
  Helena, about 1,000 miles west of Africa and 16° south of the equator, renders it difficult to
  place it in either of the sub-regions; and its scanty fauna has a general rather than any special
  resemblance to that of Africa. The entire destruction of its luxuriant native forests by the
  introduction of goats which killed all the young trees (a destruction which was nearly completed
  two centuries ago) must have led to the extermination of most of the indigenous birds and insects.
  At present there is no land bird that is believed to be really indigenous, and but one <span
  class="pagenum" id="page270">{270}</span>wader, a small plover (<i>Ægialitis sanctæ-helenæ</i>)
  which is peculiar to the island, but closely allied to African species. Numerous imported birds,
  such as canaries, Java sparrows, some African finches, guinea-fowls, and partridges, are now wild.
  There are no native butterflies, but a few introduced species of almost world-wide range. The only
  important remnant of the original fauna consists of beetles and land shells. The beetles are the
  more numerous and have been critically examined and described by Mr. T. V. Wollaston, whose
  researches in the other Atlantic islands are so well known.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera of St. Helena.</i>&mdash;Omitting those beetles which get introduced everywhere
  through man's agency, there are 59 species of Coleoptera known from St. Helena; and even of these
  there are a few widely distributed species that may have been introduced by man. It will be well,
  therefore, to confine ourselves almost wholly to the species peculiar to the island, and,
  therefore, almost certainly forming part of the endemic or original fauna. Of these we find that
  10 belong to genera which have a very wide range, and thus afford no indication of geographical
  affinity; 2 belong to genera which are characteristic of the Palæarctic fauna (<i>Bembidium</i>,
  <i>Longitarsus</i>); 3 to African genera (<i>Adoretus</i>, <i>Sciobius</i>, <i>Aspidomorpha</i>);
  and two species of <i>Calosoma</i> are most allied to African species. There are also 4 African
  species, which may be indigenous in St. Helena. The peculiar genera, 7 in number, are, however,
  the most interesting. We have first <i>Haplothorax</i>, a large beetle allied to <i>Carabus</i>
  and <i>Calosoma</i>, though of a peculiar type. This may be held to indicate a remote Palæarctic
  affinity. <i>Melissius</i>, one of the Dynastidæ, is allied to South African forms.
  <i>Microxylobius</i>, one of the Cossonides (a sub-family of Curculionidæ) is the most important
  genus, comprising as it does 13 species. It is, according to Mr. Wollaston, an altogether peculiar
  type, most allied to <i>Pentarthrum</i>, a genus found in St. Helena, Ascension, and the south of
  England, and itself very isolated. <i>Nesiotes</i>, another genus of Curculionidæ, belongs to a
  small group, the allied genera forming which inhabit Europe, Madeira, and Australia. A third
  peculiar and isolated genus is <i>Trachyphlæosoma</i>. The Anthribidæ are represented by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page271">{271}</span>2 genera, <i>Notioxenus</i> and <i>Hom&#x0153;odera</i>,
  which are altogether peculiar and isolated, and contain 9 species. Thus no less than 27 species,
  or more than half of the undoubtedly indigenous beetles, belong to 5 peculiar and very remarkable
  genera of Rhyncophora.</p>

  <p>It appears from this enumeration, that the peculiar species as a whole, exhibit most affinity
  to the Ethiopian fauna; next to the South European fauna; and lastly to that of the islands of the
  North Atlantic; while there is such a large amount of peculiarity in the most characteristic
  forms, that no special geographical affinity can be pointed out.</p>

  <p><i>Land Shells.</i>&mdash;These consist of about a dozen living species, and about as many
  extinct found in the surface soil, and probably exterminated by the destruction of the forests.
  The genera are <i>Succinea</i>, <i>Zonites</i>, <i>Helix</i>, <i>Bulimus</i>, <i>Pupa</i>, and
  <i>Achatina</i>. The <i>Bulimi</i> (all now extinct but one) comprise one large, and several small
  species, of a peculiar type, most resembling forms now inhabiting South America and the islands of
  the Pacific. <i>Zonites</i> is chiefly South European, but the other genera are of wide range, and
  none are peculiar to the island.</p>

  <p>The marine shells are mostly Mediterranean, or West Indian species, with some found in the
  Indian Ocean; only 4 or 5 species being peculiar to the island.</p>

  <p><i>Tristan d'Acunha.</i>&mdash;This small island is situated nearly midway between the Cape of
  Good Hope and the mouth of the La Plata, but it is rather nearer Africa than America, and a little
  nearer still to St. Helena. An island so truly oceanic and of whose productions so little is
  known, cannot be placed in any region, and is only noticed here because it comes naturally after
  St. Helena. It is known to possess three peculiar land birds. One is a thrush (<i>Nesocichla
  eremita</i>) whose exact affinities are not determined; the other a small water-hen (<i>Gallinula
  nesiotis</i>) allied to our native species, but with shorter and softer wings, which the bird does
  not use for flight. A finch of the genus <i>Crithagra</i> shows African affinities; while another
  recently described as <i>Nesospiza acunhæ</i> (Journ. für Orn. 1873, p. 154) forms a new genus
  said to resemble more nearly some American forms.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The only known land-shells are 2 peculiar species of <i>Balea,</i> a genus only
  found elsewhere in Europe and Brazil.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>IV. Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands, or the Malagasy Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This insular sub-region is one of the most remarkable zoological districts on the globe,
  bearing a similar relation to Africa as the Antilles to tropical America, or New Zealand to
  Australia, but possessing a much richer fauna than either of these, and in some respects a more
  remarkable one even than New Zealand. It comprises, besides Madagascar, the islands of Mauritius,
  Bourbon, and Rodriguez, the Seychelles and Comoro islands. Madagascar itself is an island of the
  first class, being a thousand miles long and about 250 miles in average width. It lies parallel to
  the coast of Africa, near the southern tropic, and is separated by 230 miles of sea from the
  nearest part of the continent, although a bank of soundings projecting from its western coast
  reduces this distance to about 160 miles. Madagascar is a mountainous island, and the greater part
  of the interior consists of open elevated plateaus; but between these and the coast there
  intervene broad belts of luxuriant tropical forests. It is this forest-district which has yielded
  most of those remarkable types of animal life which we shall have to enumerate; and it is probable
  that many more remain to be discovered. As all the main features of this sub-region are developed
  in Madagascar, we shall first endeavour to give a complete outline of the fauna of that country,
  and afterwards show how far the surrounding islands partake of its peculiarities.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The fauna of Madagascar is tolerably rich in genera and
  species of mammalia, although these belong to a very limited number of families and orders. It is
  especially characterized by its abundance of Lemuridæ and Insectivora; it also possesses a few
  peculiar Carnivora of small size; but most of the other groups in which Africa is especially
  rich&mdash;apes and monkeys, lions, leopards and hyænas, zebras, giraffes, antelopes, elephants
  and rhinoceroses, and even porcupines and squirrels, are wholly wanting. No less than 40 distinct
  families of land <span class="pagenum" id="page273">{273}</span>mammals are represented on the
  continent of Africa, only 11 of which occur in Madagascar, which also possesses 3 families
  peculiar to itself. The following is a list of all the genera of Mammalia as yet known to inhabit
  the island<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>We have here a total of 12 families, 27 genera, and 65 species of Mammals; 3 of the families
  and 20 of the genera (indicated by italics) being peculiar. All the species are peculiar, except
  perhaps one or two of the wandering bats. Remains of a <i>Hippopotamus</i> have been found in a
  sub-fossil condition, showing that this animal probably inhabited the island at a not very remote
  epoch.</p>

  <p>The assemblage of animals above noted is remarkable, and seems to indicate a very ancient
  connection with the southern portion of Africa, before the apes, ungulates, and felines had
  entered it. The lemurs, which are here so largely developed, are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page274">{274}</span>represented by a single group in Africa, with two peculiar forms on the
  West coast. They also re-appear under peculiar and isolated forms in Southern India and Malaya,
  and are evidently but the remains of a once wide-spread group, since in Eocene times they
  inhabited North America and Europe, and very probably the whole northern hemisphere. The
  Insectivora are another group of high antiquity, widely scattered over the globe under a number of
  peculiar forms; but in no equally limited area represented by so many peculiar types as in
  Madagascar. South and West Africa are also rich in this order.</p>

  <p>The Carnivora of Madagascar are mostly peculiar forms of Viverridæ, or civets, a family now
  almost confined to the Ethiopian and Oriental regions, but which was abundant in Europe during the
  Miocene period.</p>

  <p>The <i>Potamoch&#x0153;rus</i> is a peculiar <i>species</i> only, which may be perhaps
  explained by the unusual swimming powers of swine, and the semi-aquatic habits of this genus,
  leading to an immigration at a later period than in the case of the other Mammalia. The same
  remark will apply to the small <i>Hippopotamus</i>, which was coeval with the great Struthious
  bird Æpiornis.</p>

  <p>Rodents are only represented by three peculiar forms of Muridæ, but it is probable that others
  remain to be discovered.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Madagascar is exceedingly rich in birds, and especially in
  remarkable forms of Passeres. No less than 88 genera and 111 species of land-birds have been
  discovered, and every year some additions are being made to the list. The African families of
  Passeres are almost all represented, only two being absent&mdash;Paridæ and Fringillidæ, both very
  poorly represented in Africa itself. Among the Picariæ, however, the case is very different, no
  less than 7 families being absent, viz.&mdash;Picidæ, or woodpeckers; Indicatoridæ, or
  honey-guides; Megalæmidæ, or barbets; Musophagidæ, or plantain-eaters; Coliidæ, or colies;
  Bucerotidæ, or hornbills; and Irrisoridæ, or mockers. Three of these are peculiar to Africa, and
  all are well represented there, so that their absence from Madagascar is a very remarkable fact.
  The number of peculiar genera in Madagascar constitutes one of the main features of its
  ornithology, and many of these are so <span class="pagenum" id="page275">{275}</span>isolated that
  it is very difficult to classify them, and they remain to this day a puzzle to ornithologists. In
  order to exhibit clearly the striking characteristics of the bird-fauna of this island, we shall
  first give a list of all the peculiar genera; another, of the genera of which the species only are
  peculiar; and, lastly, a list of the species which Madagascar possesses in common with the African
  continent.</p>

  <p>These three tables show us an amount of speciality hardly to be found in the birds of any other
  part of the globe. Out of 111 land-birds in Madagascar, only 12 are identical with species
  inhabiting the adjacent continents, and most of these belong to powerful-winged, or wide-ranging
  forms, which probably now often pass from one country to the other. The peculiar species&mdash;49
  land-birds and 7 waders, or aquatics&mdash;are mostly well-marked forms of African genera. There
  are, however, several genera (marked by italics) which have Oriental or Palæarctic affinities, but
  not African, viz.&mdash;<i>Copsychus</i>, <i>Hypsipetes</i>, <i>Hypherpes</i>, <i>Alectrænas</i>,
  and <i>Margaroperdix</i>. These indicate a closer approximation to the Malay countries than now
  exists.</p>

  <p>The table of 33 peculiar genera is of great interest. Most of these are well-marked forms,
  belonging to families which are fully developed in Africa; though it is singular that not one of
  the exclusively African families is represented in any way in Madagascar. Others, however, are of
  remote or altogether doubtful affinities. <i>Sittidæ</i> is Oriental and Palæarctic, but not
  Ethiopian. <i>Oxylabes</i> and <i>Mystacornis</i> are of doubtful affinities. <i>Artamia</i> and
  <i>Cyanolanius</i> still more so, and it is quite undecided what family they belong to.
  <i>Calicalicus</i> is almost equally obscure. <i>Neodrepanis</i>, one of the most recent
  discoveries, seems to connect the Nectariniidæ with the Pacific <span class="pagenum"
  id="page278">{278}</span>Depanididæ. <i>Euryceros</i> is a complete puzzle, having been placed
  with the hornbills, the starlings, or as a distinct family. <i>Falculia</i> is an exceedingly
  aberrant form of starling, long thought to be allied to <i>Irrisor</i>. <i>Philepitta</i>, forming
  a distinct family, (Paictidæ), is most remarkable and isolated, perhaps with remote South American
  affinities. <i>Leptosoma</i> is another extraordinary form, connecting the cuckoos with the
  rollers. <i>Atelornis</i>, <i>Brachypteracias</i>, and <i>Geobiastes</i>, are terrestrial rollers,
  with the form and colouring of <i>Pitta</i>. So many perfectly isolated and remarkable groups are
  certainly nowhere else to be found; and they fitly associate with the wonderful aye-aye
  (<i>Chiromys</i>), the insectivorous Centetidæ, and carnivorous <i>Cryptoprocta</i> among the
  Mammalia. They speak to us plainly of enormous antiquity, of long-continued isolation; and not
  less plainly of a lost continent or continental island, in which so many, and various, and
  peculiarly organized creatures, could have been gradually developed in a connected fauna, of which
  we have here but the fragmentary remains.</p>

  <p class="sp4"><i>Plate VI.&mdash;Illustrating the characteristic features of the Zoology of
  Madagascar.</i>&mdash;The lemurs, which form the most prominent feature in the zoology of
  Madagascar, being comparatively well-known from the numerous specimens in our zoological gardens;
  and good figures of the Insectivorous genera not being available, we have represented the
  nocturnal and extraordinary aye-aye (<i>Chiromys madagascariensis</i>) to illustrate its peculiar
  and probably very ancient mammalian fauna; while the river-hogs in the distance
  (<i>Potamoch&#x0153;rus edwardsii</i>) allied to African species, indicate a later immigration
  from the mainland than in the case of most of the other Mammalia. The peculiar birds being far
  less generally known, we have figured three of them. The largest is the <i>Euryceros prevosti</i>,
  here classed with the starlings, although its remarkable bill and other peculiarities render it
  probable that it should form a distinct family. Its colours are velvety black and rich brown with
  the bill of a pearly grey. The bird beneath (<i>Vanga curvirostris</i>) is one of the peculiar
  Madagascar shrikes whose plumage, variegated with green-black and pure white is very conspicuous;
  while that in the right hand corner is the <i>Leptosoma discolor</i>, a bird which appears to be
  intermediate between such very distinct families as the cuckoos and the rollers, and is therefore
  considered to form a family by itself. It is a coppery-green above and nearly white beneath, with
  a black bill and red feet. The fan-shaped plant on the left is the traveller's tree (<i>Urania
  speciosa</i>), one of the peculiar forms of vegetation in this marvellous island.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;These present some very curious features, comparatively few of the
  African groups being represented, while there are a considerable number of Eastern and even of
  American forms. Beginning with the snakes, we find, in the enormous family of Colubridæ, none of
  the African types; but instead of them three genera&mdash;<i>Herpetodryas</i>, <i>Philodryas</i>,
  and <i>Heterodon</i>&mdash;only found elsewhere in South and North America. The Psammophidæ, which
  are both African and Indian, are represented by a peculiar genus, <i>Mimophis</i>. The Dendrophidæ
  are represented by <i>Ahætulla</i>, a genus which is both African and American. The Dryiophidæ,
  which inhabit all the tropics but are most developed in the Oriental region, are represented by a
  peculiar genus, <i>Langaha</i>. The tropical Pythonidæ are represented by another peculiar genus,
  <i>Sanzinia</i>. The Lycodontidæ and Viperidæ, so well developed in Africa, are entirely
  absent.</p>

  <p>The lizards are no less remarkable. The Zonuridæ, abundantly developed in Africa, are
  represented by one peculiar genus, <i>Cicigna</i>. The wide-spread Scincidæ by another peculiar
  genus, <i>Pygomeles</i>. The African Sepsidæ, are represented by three genera, two of which are
  African, and one, <i>Amphiglossus</i>, peculiar. The Acontiadæ are represented by a species of the
  African genus <i>Acontias</i>. Of Scincidæ there is the wide-spread <i>Euprepes</i>. The Sepidæ
  are represented by the African genera <i>Seps</i> and <i>Scelotes</i>. The Geckotidæ are not
  represented by any purely African genera, but by <i>Phyllodactylus</i>, which is American and
  Australian; <i>Hemidactylus</i>, which is spread over all the tropics; by two peculiar genera; and
  by <i>Uroplatis</i>, <i>Geckolepis</i>, and <i>Phelsuma</i>, confined to Madagascar, Bourbon, and
  the Andaman Islands. The Agamidæ, which are mostly Oriental and are represented in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page280">{280}</span>Africa by the single genus <i>Agama</i>, have here three
  peculiar genera, <i>Tracheloptychus</i>, <i>Chalarodon</i>, and <i>Hoplurus</i>. Lastly, the
  American Iguanidæ are said to be represented by a species of the South American genus
  <i>Oplurus</i>. The classification of Reptiles is in such an unsettled state that some of these
  determinations of affinities are probably erroneous; but it is not likely that any corrections
  which may be required will materially affect the general bearing of the evidence, as indicating a
  remarkable amount of Oriental and American relationship.</p>

  <p>The other groups are of less interest. Tortoises are represented by two African or wide-spread
  genera of Testudinidæ, <i>Testudo</i> and <i>Chersina</i>, and by one peculiar genus,
  <i>Pyxis</i>; and there are also two African genera of Chelydidæ.</p>

  <p>The Amphibia are not very well known. They appear to be confined to species of the wide-spread
  Ethiopian and Oriental genera&mdash;<i>Hylarana</i>, <i>Polypedates</i>, and <i>Rappia</i>
  (Polypedatidæ); and <i>Pyxicephalus</i> (Ranidæ).</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Fresh-water Fishes.</i>&mdash;These appear to be at present almost unknown. When
  carefully collected they will no doubt furnish some important facts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>The Mascarene Islands.</i></p>

  <p>The various islands which surround Madagascar&mdash;Bourbon, Mauritius, Rodriguez, the
  Seychelles, and the Comoro Islands&mdash;all partake in a considerable degree of its peculiar
  fauna, while having some special features of their own.</p>

  <p>Indigenous Mammalia (except bats) are probably absent from all these islands (except the
  Comoros), although <i>Lemur</i> and <i>Centetes</i> are given as natives of Bourbon and Mauritius.
  They have, however, perhaps been introduced from Madagascar. <i>Lemur mayottensis</i>, a peculiar
  species, is found in the Comoro Islands, where a Madagascar species of <i>Viverra</i> also
  occurs.</p>

  <p>Bourbon and Mauritius may be taken together, as they much resemble each other. They each
  possess species of a peculiar genus of Campephagidæ, or caterpillar shrikes, <i>Oxynotus</i>;
  while the remarkable <i>Fregilupus</i>, belonging to the starling family, inhabits Bourbon, if it
  is not now extinct. They also have <span class="pagenum" id="page281">{281}</span>peculiar species
  of <i>Pratincola</i>, <i>Hypsipetes</i>, <i>Phedina</i>, <i>Tchitrea</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>,
  <i>Foudia</i>, <i>Collocalia</i>, and <i>Coracopsis</i>; while Mauritius has a very peculiar form
  of dove of the sub-genus <i>Trocaza</i>; an <i>Alectrænas</i>, extinct within the last thirty
  years; and a species of the Oriental genus of parroquets, <i>Palæornis</i>. The small and remote
  island of Rodriguez has another <i>Palæornis</i>, as well as a peculiar <i>Foudia</i>, and a
  <i>Drym&#x0153;ca</i> of apparently Indian affinity.</p>

  <p>Coming to the Seychelle Islands, far to the north, we find the only mammal an Indian species of
  bat (<i>Pteropus edwardsii</i>). Of the twelve land-birds all but one are peculiar species, but
  all belong to genera found also in Madagascar, except one&mdash;a peculiar species of
  <i>Palæornis</i>. This is an Oriental genus, but found also in several Mascarene Islands and on
  the African continent. A species of black parrot (<i>Coracopsis barklayi</i>) and a weaver bird of
  peculiar type (<i>Foudia seychellarum</i>) show, however, a decided connection with Madagascar.
  There are also two peculiar pigeons&mdash;a short-winged <i>Turtur</i> and an
  <i>Alectrænas</i>.</p>

  <p>Most of the birds of the Comoro Islands are Madagascar species, only two being African. Five
  are peculiar, belonging to the genera <i>Nectarinia</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>, <i>Dicrurus</i>,
  <i>Foudia</i>, and <i>Alectrænas</i>.</p>

  <p>Reptiles are scarce. There appear to be no snakes in Mauritius and Bourbon, though some African
  species are said to be found in the Seychelle Islands. Lizards are fairly represented. Mauritius
  has <i>Cryptoblepharus</i>, an Australian genus of Gymnopthalmidæ; <i>Hemidactylus</i> (a
  wide-spread genus); <i>Peropus</i> (Oriental and Australian)&mdash;both belonging to the
  Geckotidæ. Bourbon has <i>Heteropus</i>, a Moluccan and Australian genus of Scincidæ;
  <i>Phelsuma</i> (Geckotidæ), and <i>Chameleo</i>, both found also in Madagascar; as well as
  <i>Pyxis</i>, one of the tortoises. The Seychelles have <i>Theconyx</i>, a peculiar genus of
  Geckotidæ, and <i>Chameleo</i>. Gigantic land-tortoises, which formerly inhabited most of the
  Mascarene Islands, now only survive in Aldabra, a small island north of the Seychelles. These will
  be noticed again further on. Amphibia seem only to be recorded from the Seychelles, where two
  genera of tree-frogs of the family Polypedatidæ are found; one (<i>Megalixalus</i>) peculiar, the
  other (<i>Rappia</i>) found also in Madagascar and Africa.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page282">{282}</span></div>

  <p>The few insect groups peculiar to these islands will be noted when we deal with the entomology
  of Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>Extinct fauna of the Mascarene Islands and Madagascar.</i>&mdash;Before quitting the
  vertebrate groups, we must notice the remarkable birds which have become extinct in these islands
  little more than a century ago. The most celebrated is the dodo of the Mauritius (<i>Didus
  ineptus</i>), but an allied genus, <i>Pezophaps</i>, inhabited Rodriguez, and of both of these
  almost perfect skeletons have been recovered. Other species probably existed in Bourbon. Remains
  of two genera of flightless rails have also been found, <i>Aphanapteryx</i> and
  <i>Erythromachus</i>; and even a heron (<i>Ardea megacephala</i>) which was short-winged and
  seldom flew; while in Madagascar there lived a gigantic Struthious bird, the <i>Æpyornis</i>. Some
  further details as to these extinct forms will be found under the respective families, Dididæ,
  Rallidæ, and Æpyornithidæ, in the fourth part of this work; and their bearing on the past history
  of the region will be adverted to in the latter part of this chapter. Dr. Günther has recently
  distinguished five species of fossil tortoises from Mauritius and Rodriguez,&mdash;all of them
  quite different from the living species of Aldabra.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The butterflies of Madagascar are not so remarkable as some other orders
  of insects. There seems to be only one peculiar genus, <i>Heteropsis</i> (Satyridæ). The other
  genera are African, <i>Leptoneura</i> being confined to Madagascar and South Africa. There are
  some fine <i>Papilios</i> of uncommon forms. The most interesting lepidopterous insect, however,
  is the fine diurnal moth (<i>Urania</i>), as all the other species of the genus inhabit tropical
  America and the West Indian Islands.</p>

  <p>The Coleoptera have been better collected, and exhibit some very remarkable affinities. There
  is but one peculiar genus of Cicindelidæ, <i>Pogonostoma</i>, which is allied to the South
  American genus, <i>Ctenostoma</i>. Another genus, <i>Peridexia</i>, is common to Madagascar and
  South America. None of the important African genera are represented, except <i>Eurymorpha</i>;
  while <i>Meglaomma</i> is common to Madagascar and the Oriental region.</p>

  <p>In the Carabidæ we have somewhat similar phenomena on a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page283">{283}</span>wider scale. Such large and important African genera as <i>Polyhirma</i>
  and <i>Anthia</i>, are absent; but there are four genera in common with South Africa, and two with
  West Africa; while three others are as much Oriental as African. One genus, <i>Distrigus</i>, is
  wholly Oriental; and another, <i>Homalosoma</i>, Australian. <i>Colpodes</i>, well developed in
  Bourbon and Mauritius, is Oriental and South American. Of the peculiar genera, <i>Sphærostylis</i>
  has South American affinities; <i>Microchila</i>, Oriental; the others being related to widely
  distributed genera.</p>

  <p>The Lucanidæ are few in number, and all have African affinities. Madagascar is very rich in
  Cetoniidæ, and possesses 20 peculiar genera. <i>Bothrorhina</i>, and three other genera belonging
  to the <i>Ichnostoma</i> group, have wholly African relations. <i>Doryscelis</i> and
  <i>Chromoptila</i> are no less clearly allied to Oriental genera. A series of eight peculiar
  genera belong to the Schizorhinidæ, a family the bulk of which are Australian, while there are
  only a few African forms. The remaining genera appear to have African affinities, but few of the
  peculiarly African genera are represented. <i>Glyciphana</i> is characteristic of the Oriental
  region.</p>

  <p>The Buprestidæ of Madagascar consist mainly of one large and peculiar genus,
  <i>Polybothris</i>, allied to the almost cosmopolite <i>Psiloptera</i>. Most of the other genera
  are both Ethiopian and Oriental; but <i>Polycesta</i> is mainly South American, and the remarkable
  and isolated genus <i>Sponsor</i> is confined to the Mauritius with a species in Celebes and New
  Guinea.</p>

  <p>The Longicorns are numerous and interesting, there being no less than 24 peculiar genera. Two
  of the genera of Prionidæ are very isolated, while a third, <i>Closterus</i>, belongs to a group
  which is Malayan and American.</p>

  <p>Of the Cerambycidæ, <i>Philematium</i> ranges to Africa and the West Indies; <i>Leptocera</i>
  is only found eastward in Ceylon and the New Hebrides; while <i>Euporus</i> is African. Of the
  peculiar genera, 2 are of African type; 3 belong to the <i>Leptura</i> group, which are mostly
  Palæarctic and Oriental, with a few in South Africa; while <i>Philocalocera</i> is allied to a
  South American genus.</p>

  <p>Among the Lamiidæ there are several wide-ranging and 7 <span class="pagenum"
  id="page284">{284}</span>African genera; but <i>Coptops</i> is Oriental, and the Oriental
  <i>Praonetha</i> occurs in the Comoro Islands. Among the peculiar genera several have African
  affinities, but <i>Tropidema</i> belongs to a group which is Oriental and Australian;
  <i>Oopsis</i> is found also in the Pacific Islands; <i>Mythergates</i>, <i>Sulemus</i>, and
  <i>Coedomæa</i>, are allied to Malayan and American genera.</p>

  <p><i>General Remarks on the Insect-fauna of Madagascar.</i>&mdash;Taking the insects as a whole,
  we find the remarkable result that their affinities are largely Oriental, Australian, and South
  American: while the African element is represented chiefly by special South African or West
  African forms, rather than by such as are widely spread over the Ethiopian region.<a id="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In some families&mdash;as Cetoniidæ and Lamiidæ&mdash;the
  African element appears to preponderate; in others&mdash;as Cicindelidæ&mdash;the South American
  affinity seems strongest; in Carabidæ, perhaps the Oriental; while in Buprestidæ and Cerambycidæ
  the African and foreign elements seem nearly balanced. We must not impute too much importance to
  these foreign alliances among insects, because we find examples of them in every country on the
  globe. The reason they are so much more pronounced in Madagascar may be, that during long periods
  of time this island has served as a refuge for groups that have been dying out on the great
  continents; and that, owing to the numerous deficiencies of a somewhat similar kind in the series
  of vertebrata in Australia and South America, the same groups have often been able to maintain
  themselves in all these countries as well as in Madagascar. It must be remembered too, that these
  peculiarities in the Malagasy and Mascarene insect-fauna are but exaggerations of a like
  phenomenon on the mainland. Africa also has numerous affinities with South America, with the Malay
  countries, and with Australia; but they do not bear anything like so large a proportion to the
  whole fauna, and do not, therefore, attract so much attention. The special conditions of existence
  and the long-continued isolation of Madagascar, will account for much of this difference; and it
  will evidently not be necessary <span class="pagenum" id="page285">{285}</span>to introduce, as
  some writers are disposed to do, a special land connection or near approach between Madagascar and
  all these countries, independently of Africa; except perhaps in the case of the Malay Islands, as
  will be discussed further on.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Land-shells.</i>&mdash;Madagascar and the adjacent islands are all rich in
  land-shells. The genera of Helicidæ are <i>Vitrina</i>, <i>Helix</i>, <i>Achatina</i>,
  <i>Columna</i> (peculiar to Madagascar and West Africa), <i>Buliminus</i>, <i>Cionella</i>
  (chiefly Oriental and South American, but not African), <i>Pupa</i>, <i>Streptaxis</i>, and
  <i>Succinea</i>. Among the Operculata we have <i>Truncatella</i> (widely scattered, but not
  African); <i>Cyclotus</i> (South American, Oriental, and South African); <i>Cyclophorus</i>
  (mostly Oriental, with a few South African); <i>Leptopoma</i> (Oriental); <i>Megalomastoma</i>
  (Malayan and South American); <i>Lithidion</i> (peculiar to Madagascar, Socotra, and South-West
  Arabia); <i>Otopoma</i> (with the same range, but extending to West India and New Ireland);
  <i>Cyclostomus</i> (widely spread but not African); and <i>Omphalotropis</i> (wholly Oriental and
  Australian). We thus find the same general features reproduced in the land-shells as in the
  insects, and the same remarks will to a great extent apply to both. The classification of the
  former is, however, by no means so satisfactory, and we have no extensive and accurate general
  catalogues of shells, like those of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, which have furnished us with such
  valuable materials for the comparison of the several faunas.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>On the probable Past History of the Ethiopian Region.</i></p>

  <p>Perhaps none of the great zoological regions of the earth present us with problems of greater
  difficulty or higher interest than the Ethiopian. We find in it the evidence of several distinct
  and successive faunas, now intermingled; and it is very difficult, with our present imperfect
  knowledge, to form an adequate conception of how and when the several changes occurred. There are,
  however, a few points which seem sufficiently clear, and these afford us a secure foundation in
  our endeavour to comprehend the rest.</p>

  <p>Let us then consider what are the main facts we have to account for.&mdash;1. In Continental
  Africa, more especially in the south <span class="pagenum" id="page286">{286}</span>and west, we
  find, along with much that is peculiar, a number of genera showing a decided Oriental, and others
  with an equally strong South American affinity; this latter more particularly showing itself among
  reptiles and insects. 2. All over Africa, but more especially in the east, we have abundance of
  large ungulates and felines&mdash;antelopes, giraffes, buffaloes, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
  with lions, leopards, and hyænas, all of types now or recently found in India and Western Asia. 3.
  But we also have to note the absence of a number of groups which abound in the above-named
  countries, such as deer, bears, moles, and true pigs; while camels and goats&mdash;characteristic
  of the desert regions just to the north of the Ethiopian&mdash;are equally wanting. 4. There is a
  wonderful unity of type and want of speciality in the vast area of our first sub-region extending
  from Senegal across to the east coast, and southward to the Zambezi; while West Africa and South
  Africa each abound in peculiar types. 5. We have the extraordinary fauna of Madagascar to account
  for, with its evident main derivation from Africa, yet wanting all the larger and higher African
  forms; its resemblances to Malaya and to South America; and its wonderful assemblage of altogether
  peculiar types.</p>

  <p>Here we find a secure starting-point, for we are sure that Madagascar must have been separated
  from Africa before the assemblage of large animals enumerated above, had entered it. Now, it is a
  suggestive fact, that all these belong to types which abounded in Europe and India about the
  Miocene period. It is also known, from the prevalence of Tertiary deposits over the Sahara and
  much of Arabia, Persia, and Northern India, that during early Tertiary times a continuous sea from
  the Bay of Bengal to the British Isles completely cut off all land communication between Central
  and Southern Africa on the one side, and the great continent of the Eastern hemisphere on the
  other. When Africa was thus isolated, its fauna probably had a character somewhat analogous to
  that of South America at the same period. Most of the higher types of mammalian life were absent,
  while lemurs, Edentates, and Insectivora took their place. At this period Madagascar was no doubt
  united with Africa, <span class="pagenum" id="page287">{287}</span>and helped to form a great
  southern continent which must at one time have extended eastward as far as Southern India and
  Ceylon; and over the whole of this the lemurine type no doubt prevailed.</p>

  <p>During some portion of this period, South Temperate Africa must have had a much greater
  extension, perhaps indicated by the numerous shoals and rocks to the south and east of the Cape of
  Good Hope, and by the Crozets and Kerguelen Islands further to the south-east. This would have
  afforded means for that intercommunion with Western Australia which is so clearly marked in the
  flora, and to some extent also in the insects of the two countries; and some such extension is
  absolutely required for the development of that wonderfully rich and peculiar temperate flora and
  fauna, which, now crowded into a narrow territory, is one of the greatest marvels of the organic
  world.</p>

  <p>During this early period, when the great southern continents&mdash;South America, Africa, and
  Australia&mdash;were equally free from the incursions of the destructive felines of the north, the
  Struthious or ostrich type of birds was probably developed into its existing forms. It is not at
  all necessary to suppose that these three continents were at any time united, in order to account
  for the distribution of these great terrestrial birds; as this may have arisen by at least two
  other easily conceivable modes. The ancestral Struthious type may, like the Marsupial, have once
  spread over the larger portion of the globe; but as higher forms, especially of Carnivora, became
  developed, it would be exterminated everywhere but in those regions where it was free from their
  attacks. In each of these it would develope into special forms adapted to surrounding conditions;
  and the large size, great strength, and excessive speed of the ostrich, may have been a
  comparatively late development caused by its exposure to the attacks of enemies which rendered
  such modification necessary. This seems the most probable explanation of the distribution of
  Struthious birds, and it is rendered almost certain by the discovery of remains of this order in
  Europe in Eocene deposits, and by the occurrence of an ostrich among the fossils of the Siwalik
  hills; but it is just possible, also, that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page288">{288}</span>ancestral type may have been a bird capable of flight, and that it spread
  from one of the three southern continents to the others at the period of their near approach, and
  more or less completely lost the power of flight owing to the long continued absence of
  enemies.</p>

  <p>During the period we have been considering, the ancestors of existing apes and monkeys
  flourished (as we have seen in Chapter VI.) along the whole southern shores of the old Palæarctic
  continent; and it seems likely that they first entered Africa by means of a land connection
  indicated by the extensive and lofty plateaus of the Sahara, situated to the south-east of Tunis
  and reaching to a little north-west of Lake Tchad; and at the same time the elephant and
  rhinoceros type may have entered. This will account for the curious similarity between the higher
  faunas of West Africa and the Indo-Malay sub-region, for owing to the present distribution of land
  and sea and the narrowing of the tropical zone since Miocene times, these are now the only
  lowland, equatorial, forest-clad countries, which were in connection with the southern shores of
  the old Palæarctic continent at the time of its greatest luxuriance and development. This western
  connection did not probably last long, the junction that led to the greatest incursion of new
  forms, and the complete change in the character of the African fauna, having apparently been
  effected by way of Syria and the shores of the Red Sea at a somewhat later date. By this route the
  old South-Palæarctic fauna, indicated by the fossils of Pikermi and the Siwalik Hills, poured into
  Africa; and finding there a new and favourable country, almost wholly unoccupied by large
  Mammalia, increased to an enormous extent, developed into new forms, and finally overran the whole
  continent.</p>

  <p>Before this occurred, however, a great change had taken place in the geography of Africa. It
  had gradually diminished on the south and east; Madagascar had been left isolated; while a number
  of small islands, banks, and coral reefs in the Indian Ocean alone remained to indicate the
  position of a once extensive equatorial land. The Mascarene Islands appear to represent the
  portion which separated earliest, before any carnivora had <span class="pagenum"
  id="page289">{289}</span>reached the country; and it was in consequence of this total exemption
  from danger, that several groups of birds altogether incapable of flight became developed here,
  culminating in the huge and unwieldy Dodo, and the more active Aphanapteryx. To the same cause may
  be attributed the development, in these islands, of gigantic land-tortoises, far surpassing any
  others now living on the globe. They appear to have formerly inhabited Mauritius, Bourbon, and
  Rodriguez, and perhaps all the other Mascarene islands, but having been recklessly destroyed, now
  only survive in the small uninhabited Aldabra islands north of the Seychelle group. The largest
  living specimen (5½ feet long) is now in our Zoological Gardens. The only other place where
  equally large tortoises (of an allied species) are found, is the Galapagos islands, where they
  were equally free from enemies till civilized man came upon the scene; who, partly by using them
  for food, partly by the introduction of pigs, which destroy the eggs, has greatly diminished their
  numbers and size, and will probably soon wholly exterminate them. It is a curious fact,
  ascertained by Dr. Günther, that the tortoises of the Galapagos are more nearly related to the
  extinct tortoises of Mauritius than is the living tortoise of Aldabra. This would imply that
  several distinct groups or sub-genera of <i>Testudo</i> have had a wide range over the globe, and
  that some of each have survived in very distant localities. This is rendered quite conceivable by
  the known antiquity of the genus <i>Testudo</i>, which dates back to at least the Eocene formation
  (in North America) with very little change of form. These sluggish reptiles, so long-lived and so
  tenacious of life, may have remained unchanged, while every higher animal type around them has
  become extinct and been replaced by very different forms; as in the case of the living <i>Emys
  tectum</i>, which is the sole survivor of the strange Siwalik fauna of the Miocene epoch. The
  ascertained history of the genus and the group, thus affords a satisfactory explanation of the
  close affinity of the gigantic tortoises of Mauritius and the Galapagos.</p>

  <p>The great island of Madagascar seems to have remained longer united with Africa, till some of
  the smaller and more active <span class="pagenum" id="page290">{290}</span>carnivora had reached
  it; and we consequently find there, no wholly terrestrial form of bird but the gigantic and
  powerful <i>Æpyornis</i>, well able to defend itself against such enemies. As already intimated,
  we refer the South American element in Madagascar, not to any special connection of the two
  countries independently of Africa, but to the preservation there of a number of forms, some
  derived from America through Africa, others of once almost cosmopolitan range, but which, owing to
  the severer competition, have become extinct on the African continent, while they have continued
  to exist under modified forms in the two other countries.</p>

  <p>The depths of all the great oceans are now known to be so profound, that we cannot conceive the
  elevation of their beds above the surface without some corresponding depression elsewhere. And if,
  as is probable, these opposite motions of the earth's crust usually take place in parallel bands,
  and are to some extent dependent on each other, an elevation of the sea bed could hardly fail to
  lead to the submergence of large tracts of existing continents; and this is the more likely to
  occur on account of the great disproportion that we have seen exists between the mean height of
  the land and the mean depth of the ocean. Keeping this principle in view, we may, with some
  probability, suggest the successive stages by which the Ethiopian region assumed its present form,
  and acquired the striking peculiarities that characterise its several sub-regions. During the
  early period, when the rich and varied temperate flora of the Cape, and its hardly less peculiar
  forms of insects and of low type mammalia, were in process of development in an extensive south
  temperate land, we may be pretty sure that the whole of the east and much of the north of Africa
  was deep sea. At a later period, when this continent sank towards the south and east, the
  elevation may have occurred which connected Madagascar with Ceylon; and only at a still later
  epoch, when the Indian Ocean had again been formed, did central, eastern, and northern Africa
  gradually rise above the ocean, and effect a connection with the great northern continent by way
  of Abyssinia and Arabia. And if this last change took place with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page291">{291}</span>tolerable rapidity, or if the elevatory force acted from the north
  towards the south, there would be a new and unoccupied territory to be taken possession of by
  immigrants from the north, together with a few from the south and west. The more highly-organised
  types from the great northern continent, however, would inevitably prevail; and we should thus
  have explained the curious uniformity in the fauna of so large an area, together with the absence
  from it of those peculiar Ethiopian types which so abundantly characterise the other three
  sub-regions.</p>

  <p>We may now perhaps see the reason of the singular absence from tropical Africa of deer and
  bears; for these are both groups which live in fertile or well-wooded countries, whereas the line
  of immigration from Europe to Africa was probably always, as now, to a great extent a dry and
  desert tract, suited to antelopes and large felines, but almost impassable to deer and bears. We
  find, too, that whereas remains of antelopes and giraffes abound in the Miocene deposits of
  Greece, there were no deer (which are perhaps a somewhat later development); neither were there
  any bears, but numerous forms of Felidæ, Viverridæ, Mustelidæ, and ancestral forms of
  <i>Hyæna</i>, exactly suited to be the progenitors of the most prevalent types of modern African
  Zoology.</p>

  <p>There appears to have been one other change in the geography of Africa and the Atlantic Ocean
  that requires notice. The rather numerous cases of close similarity in the insect forms of
  tropical Africa and America, seem to indicate some better means of transmission, at a not very
  remote epoch, than now exists. The vast depth of the Atlantic, and the absence of any
  corresponding likeness in the vertebrate fauna, entirely negative the idea of any union between
  the two countries; but a moderate extension of their shores towards each other is not improbable,
  and this, with large islands in the place of the Cape Verd group, St. Paul's Rocks, and Fernando
  Noronha, to afford resting places in the Atlantic, would probably suffice to explain the amount of
  similarity that actually exists.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Our knowledge of the geology and palæontology of Africa <span class="pagenum"
  id="page292">{292}</span>being so scanty, it would be imprudent to attempt any more detailed
  explanation of the peculiarities of its existing fauna. The sketch now given is, it is believed,
  founded on a sufficient basis of facts to render it not only a possible but a probable account of
  what took place; and it is something gained to be able to show, that a large portion of the
  peculiarities and anomalies of so remarkable a fauna as that of the Ethiopian region, can be
  accounted for by a series of changes of physical geography during the tertiary epoch, which can
  hardly be considered extreme, or in any way unlikely to have occurred.</p>

  ORIENTAL REGION.</span></span></p>

  <p class="sp5">This region is of comparatively small extent, but it has a very diversified
  surface, and is proportionately very rich. The deserts on the north-west of India are the
  debatable land that separates it from the Palæarctic and Ethiopian regions. The great triangular
  plateau which forms the peninsula of India is the poorest portion of the region, owing in part to
  its arid climate and in part to its isolated position; for there can be little doubt that in the
  later Tertiary period it was an island, separated by an arm of the sea (now forming the valleys of
  the Ganges and Indus) from the luxuriant Himalayan and Burmese countries. Its southern extremity,
  with Ceylon, has a moister climate and more luxuriant vegetation, and exhibits indications of a
  former extension southwards, with a richer and more peculiar fauna, partly Malayan and partly
  Mascarene in its character. The whole southern slopes of the Himalayas, with Burmah, Siam and
  Western China, as well as the Malay peninsula and the Indo-Malay islands, are almost everywhere
  covered with tropical forests of the most luxuriant character, which abound in varied and peculiar
  forms of vegetable and animal life. The flora and fauna of this extensive district are essentially
  of one type throughout; yet it may be usefully divided into the Indo-Chinese and the Malayan
  sub-regions, as each possesses a number of peculiar or characteristic animals. The former
  sub-region, besides having many tropical and sub-tropical types of its own, also possesses a large
  number of peculiarly modified temperate forms on the mountain ranges of its northern boundary,
  which are wholly wanting in the Malayan sub-region. The Philippine islands are best classed with
  the Indo-Malay group, although they are strikingly deficient in many Malayan types, and exhibit an
  approach to the Celebesian division of the Austro-Malay sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Zoological Characteristics of the Oriental Region.</i>&mdash;The Oriental Region possesses
  examples of 35 families of Mammalia, 71 of Birds, 35 of Reptiles, 9 of Amphibia, and 13 of
  Fresh-water Fishes. Of these 163 families, 12 are peculiar to the region; namely, Tarsiidæ,
  Galeopithecidæ, and Tupaiidæ among Mammalia, while Æluridæ, though confined to the higher
  Himalayas, may perhaps with more justice be claimed by the Palæarctic region; Liotrichidæ,
  Phyllornithidæ, and Eurylæmidæ among birds; Xenopeltidæ (extending, however, to Celebes),
  Uropeltidæ, and Acrochordidæ among reptiles; Luciocephalidæ, Ophiocephalidæ and Mastacembelidæ
  among fresh-water fishes. A number of other families are abundant, and characteristic of the
  region; and it possesses many peculiar and characteristic genera, which must be referred to
  somewhat more in detail.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The Oriental region is rich in quadrumana, and is especially remarkable
  for its orang-utans and long-armed apes (<i>Simia</i>, <i>Hylobates</i>, and <i>Siamanga</i>); its
  abundance of monkeys of the genera <i>Presbytes</i> and <i>Macacus</i>; its extraordinary
  long-nosed monkey (<i>Presbytes nasalis</i>); its Lemuridæ (<i>Nycticebus</i> and <i>Loris</i>);
  and its curious genus <i>Tarsius</i>, forming a distinct family of lemurs. All these quadrumanous
  genera are confined to it, except <i>Tarsius</i> which extends as far as Celebes. It possesses
  more than 30 genera of bats, which are enumerated in the lists given at the end of this chapter.
  In Insectivora it is very rich, and possesses several remarkable forms, such as the flying lemur
  (<i>Galeopithecus</i>); the squirrel-like Tupaiidæ consisting of three genera; and the curious
  <i>Gymnura</i> allied to the hedgehogs. In Carnivora, it is especially rich in many forms of
  civets (Viverridæ), possessing 10 peculiar genera, among which <i>Prionodon</i> and
  <i>Cynogale</i> are remarkable; numerous Mustelidæ, of which <i>Gymnopus</i>, <i>Mydaus</i>,
  <i>Aonyx</i> and <i>Helictis</i> are the most conspicuous; <i>Ælurus</i>, a curious animal,
  cat-like in appearance but <span class="pagenum" id="page316">{316}</span>more allied to the
  bears, forming a distinct family of Carnivora, and confined to the high forest-districts of the
  Eastern Himalayas and East Thibet; <i>Melursus</i> and <i>Helarctos</i>, peculiar forms of bears;
  <i>Platanista</i>, a dolphin peculiar to the Ganges and Indus. Among Ruminants it has the
  beautiful chevrotain, forming the genus <i>Tragulus</i> in the family Tragulidæ; with one peculiar
  genus and three peculiar sub-genera of true deer. The Antilopinæ and Caprinæ are few, confined to
  limited districts and not characteristic of the region; but there are everywhere wild cattle of
  the genera <i>Bibos</i> and <i>Bubalus</i>, which, with species of <i>Rhinoceros</i> and
  <i>Elephas</i>, form a prominent feature in the fauna. The Rodents are less developed than in the
  Ethiopian region, but several forms of squirrels everywhere abound, together with some species of
  porcupine; and the Edentata are represented by the scaly manis.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The families and genera of birds which give a character to Oriental lands,
  are so numerous and varied, that we can here only notice the more prominent and more remarkable.
  The Timaliidæ, represented by the babblers (<i>Garrulax</i>, <i>Pomatorhinus</i>, <i>Timalia</i>,
  &amp;c.), are almost everywhere to be met with, and no less than 21 genera are peculiar to the
  region; the elegant fork-tailed <i>Enicurus</i> and rich blue <i>Myiophonus</i>, though
  comparatively scarce, are characteristic of the Malayan and Indo-Chinese faunas; the elegant
  little "hill-tits" (Liotrichidæ) abound in the same part of the region; the green bulbuls
  (<i>Phyllornis</i>) are found everywhere; as are various forms of Pycnonotidæ, the black and
  crimson "minivets" (<i>Pericrocotus</i>), and the glossy "king-crows" (<i>Dicrurus</i>);
  <i>Urocissa</i>, <i>Platylophus</i> and <i>Dendrocitta</i> are some of the interesting and
  characteristic forms of the crow family; sun-birds (Nectariniidæ) of at least three genera are
  found throughout the region, as are the beautiful little flower-peckers (Dicæidæ), and some
  peculiar forms of weaver-birds (<i>Ploceus</i> and <i>Munia</i>). Of the starling family, the most
  conspicuous are the glossy mynahs (<i>Eulabes</i>). The swallow-shrikes (<i>Artamus</i>) are very
  peculiar, as are the exquisitely coloured pittas (Pittidæ), and the gaudy broad-bills
  (Eurylæmidæ). Leaving the true Passeres, we find woodpeckers, barbets, and cuckoos everywhere,
  often of peculiar and <span class="pagenum" id="page317">{317}</span>remarkable forms; among the
  bee-eaters we have the exquisite <i>Nyctiornis</i> with its pendent neck-plumes of blue or
  scarlet; brilliant kingfishers and strangely formed hornbills abound everywhere; while
  brown-backed trogons with red and orange breasts, though far less frequent, are equally a feature
  of the Ornithology. Next we have the frog-mouthed goatsuckers (<i>Battrachostomus</i>), and the
  whiskered swifts (<i>Dendrochelidon</i>), both wide-spread, remarkable, and characteristic groups
  of the Oriental region. Coming to the parrot tribe, we have only the long-tailed <i>Palæornis</i>
  and the exquisite little <i>Loriculus</i>, as characteristic genera. We now come to the pigeons,
  among which the fruit-eating genera <i>Treron</i> and <i>Carpophaga</i> are the most conspicuous.
  The gallinaceous birds offer us some grand forms, such as the peacocks (<i>Pavo</i>); the argus
  pheasants (<i>Argusianus</i>); the fire-backed pheasants (<i>Euplocamus</i>); and the jungle-fowl
  (<i>Gallus</i>), all strikingly characteristic; and with these we may close our sketch, since the
  birds of prey and the two Orders comprising the waders and swimmers offer nothing sufficiently
  remarkable to be worthy of enumeration here.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Only the more abundant and characteristic groups will here be noticed.
  In the serpent tribe, the Oligodontidæ, a small family of ground-snakes; the Homalopsidæ, or
  fresh-water snakes; the Dendrophidæ, or tree-snakes; the Dryiophidæ, or whip-snakes; the
  Dipsadidæ, or nocturnal tree-snakes; the Lycodontidæ or fanged ground-snakes; the Pythonidæ, or
  rock-snakes; the Elapidæ, or venomous colubrine snakes (including the "cobras"); and the
  Crotalidæ, or pit-vipers, are all abundant and characteristic, ranging over nearly the whole
  region, and presenting a great variety of genera and species. Among lizards, the Varanidæ or
  water-lizards; the Scincidæ or "scinks;" the Geckotidæ, or geckoes; and the Agamidæ, or eastern
  iguanas; are the most universal and characteristic groups. Among crocodiles the genus
  <i>Crocodilus</i> is widely spread, <i>Gavialis</i> being characteristic of the Ganges. Among
  Chelonia, or shielded reptiles, forms of fresh-water Testudinidæ and Trionychidæ (soft tortoises)
  are tolerably abundant.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;The only abundant and characteristic groups of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page318">{318}</span>this class are toads of the family Engystomidæ; tree-frogs of the family
  Polypedatidæ; and several genera of true frogs, Ranidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fishes.</i>&mdash;The more remarkable and characteristic fishes inhabiting the
  fresh waters of the Oriental region belong to the following families: Nandidæ, Labyrinthici,
  Ophiocephalidæ, Siluridæ, and Cyprinidæ; the last being specially abundant.</p>

  <p>The sketch here very briefly given, must be supplemented by an examination of the tables of
  distribution of the genera of all the Mammalia and Birds inhabiting the region. We will now
  briefly summarize the results.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of the Oriental Vertebrata.</i>&mdash;The Oriental region possesses examples of 163
  families of Vertebrata of which 12 are peculiar, a proportion of a little more than one-fourteenth
  of the whole.</p>

  <p>Out of 118 genera of Mammalia 54 seem to be peculiar to the region, equal to a proportion of
  <span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span> or a little less than half. Of
  Land-Birds there are 342 genera of which 165 are peculiar, bringing the proportion very close to a
  half.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the Ethiopian region the proportion of peculiar forms both of Mammalia and Birds
  is greater; a fact which is not surprising when we consider the long continued isolation of the
  latter region&mdash;an isolation which is even now very complete, owing to the vast extent of
  deserts intervening between it and the Palæarctic region; while the Oriental and Palæarctic were,
  during much of the Tertiary epoch, hardly separable.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Insects.</i></p>

  <p><i>Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;We can only glance hastily at the more prominent features of the
  wonderfully rich and varied butterfly-fauna of the Oriental region. In the first family Danaidæ,
  the genera <i>Danais</i> and <i>Eupl&#x0153;a</i> are everywhere abundant, and the latter
  especially forms a conspicuous feature in the entomological aspect of the country; the large
  "spectre-butterflies" (<i>Hestia</i>) are equally characteristic of the Malayan sub-region.
  Satyridæ, though abundant are not very remarkable, <i>Debis</i>, <i>Melanitis</i>,
  <i>Mycalesis</i>, and <i>Ypthima</i> being the most characteristic <span class="pagenum"
  id="page319">{319}</span>genera. Morphidæ are well represented by the genera <i>Amathusia</i>,
  <i>Zeuxidia</i>, <i>Discophora</i>, and <i>Thaumantis</i>, some of the species of which almost
  equal the grand South American Morphos. The Nymphalidæ furnish us with a host of characteristic
  genera, among the most remarkable of which are, <i>Terinos</i>, <i>Adolias</i>, <i>Cethosia</i>,
  <i>Cyrestis</i>, <i>Limenitis</i>, and <i>Nymphalis</i>, all abounding in beautiful species. Among
  the Lycænidæ are a number of fine groups, among which we may mention <i>Ilerda</i>, <i>Myrina</i>,
  <i>Deudoryx</i>, <i>Aphneus</i>, <i>Iolaus</i>, and <i>Amblypodia</i>, as characteristic examples.
  The Pieridæ furnish many fine forms, such as <i>Thyca</i>, <i>Iphias</i>, <i>Thestias</i>,
  <i>Eronia</i>, <i>Prioneris</i>, and <i>Dercas</i>, the last two being peculiar. The Papilionidæ
  are unsurpassed in the world, presenting such grand genera as <i>Teinopalpus</i> and
  <i>Bhutanitis</i>; the yellow-marked <i>Ornithopteræ</i>; the superb "Brookiana;" the elegant
  <i>Leptocercus</i>; and <i>Papilios</i> of the "Coon," "Philoxenus," "Memnon," "Protenor," and
  especially the 'green-and-gold-dusted' "Paris" groups.</p>

  <p>The Moths call for no special observations, except to notice the existence in Northern India of
  a number of forms which resemble in a striking manner some of the most remarkable of the above
  mentioned groups of the genus <i>Papilio</i>, especially the "Protenor" group, which there is
  reason to believe protected by a peculiar smell or taste like the <i>Heliconias</i> and
  Danaidæ.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The most characteristic Oriental form of the Cicindelidæ or tiger
  beetles, is undoubtedly the elegant genus <i>Collyris</i>, which is found over the whole region
  and is almost confined to it. Less abundant, but equally characteristic, is the wingless ant-like
  <i>Tricondyla</i>. Two small genera <i>Apteroessa</i> and <i>Dromicidia</i> are confined to the
  Indian Peninsula, while <i>Therates</i> only occurs in the Malayan sub-region.</p>

  <p>The Carabidæ, or ground carnivorous beetles, are so numerous that we can only notice a few of
  the more remarkable and characteristic forms. The wonderful <i>Mormolyce</i> of the Indo-Malay
  sub-region, stands pre-eminent for singularity in the entire family. <i>Thyreopterus</i>,
  <i>Orthogonius</i>, <i>Catascopus</i>, and <i>Pericallus</i> are very characteristic forms, as
  well as <i>Planetes</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page320">{320}</span><i>Distrigus</i>, the
  latter having a single species in Madagascar. There are 80 genera of this family peculiar to the
  region, 10 of which have only been found in Ceylon.</p>

  <p>Among the Lucanidæ, or stag-beetles, <i>Lucanus</i>, <i>Odontolabris</i>, and
  <i>Cladognathus</i> are the most characteristic forms. Sixteen genera inhabit the region, of which
  7 are altogether peculiar, while three others only extend eastward to the Austro-Malayan
  sub-region.</p>

  <p>The beautiful Cetoniidæ, or rose-chafers, are well represented by <i>Rhomborhina</i>,
  <i>Heterorhina</i>, <i>Clinteria</i>, <i>Macronota</i>, <i>Agestrata</i>, <i>Chalcothea</i> and
  many fine species of <i>Cetonia</i>. There are 17 peculiar genera, of which <i>Mycteristes</i>,
  <i>Phædimus</i>, <i>Plectrone</i>, and <i>Rhagopteryx</i>, are Malayan; while <i>Narycius</i>,
  <i>Clerota</i>, <i>Bombodes</i>, and <i>Chiloloba</i> are Indian.</p>

  <p>In Buprestidæ&mdash;those elongate metallic-coloured beetles whose elytra are used as ornaments
  in many parts of the world&mdash;this region stands pre-eminent, in its gigantic
  <i>Catoxantha</i>, its fine <i>Chrysochroa</i>, its Indian <i>Sternocera</i>, its Malayan
  <i>Chalcophora</i> and <i>Belionota</i>, as well as many other beautiful forms. It possesses 41
  genera, of which 14 are peculiar to it, the rest being generally of wide range or common to the
  Ethiopian and Australian regions.</p>

  <p>In the extensive and elegant group of Longicorns, the Oriental region is only inferior to the
  Neotropical. It possesses 360 genera, 25 of which are Prionidæ, 117 Cerambicidæ, and 218
  Lamiidæ;&mdash;about 70 per cent. of the whole being peculiar. The most characteristic genera are
  <i>Rhaphidopodus</i> and <i>Ægosoma</i> among Prionidæ; <i>Neocerambyx</i>, <i>Euryarthrum</i>,
  <i>Pachyteria</i>, <i>Acrocyrta</i>, <i>Tetraommatus</i>, <i>Chloridolum</i>, and <i>Polyzonus</i>
  among Cerambycidæ; and <i>C&#x0153;losterna</i>, <i>Rhytidophora</i>, <i>Batocera</i>,
  <i>Agelasta</i>, and <i>Astathes</i> among Lamiidæ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of remarkable forms in other families, we may mention the gigantic horned
  <i>Chalcosoma</i> among Scarabæidæ; the metallic <i>Campsosternus</i> among Elateridæ; the
  handsome but anomalous <i>Trictenotoma</i> forming a distinct family; the gorgeous
  <i>Pachyrhynchi</i> of the Philippine Islands among Curculionidæ; <i>Diurus</i> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page321">{321}</span>among Brenthidæ; with an immense number and variety of
  Anthotribidæ, Heteromera, Malacoderma, and Phytophaga.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Oriental Sub-regions.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The four sub-regions into which we have divided the Oriental region, are very
  unequal in extent, and perhaps more so in productiveness, but they each have well-marked special
  features, and serve well to exhibit the main zoological characteristics of the region. As they are
  all tolerably well defined and their faunas comparatively well-known, their characteristics will
  be given with rather more than usual detail.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>I. Hindostan, or Indian Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This includes the whole peninsula of India from the foot of the Himalayas on the north to
  somewhere near Seringapatam on the south, the boundary of the Ceylonese sub-region being
  unsettled. The deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra mark its eastern limits, and it probably
  reaches to about Cashmere in the north-west, and perhaps to the valley of the Indus further south;
  but the great desert tract to the east of the Indus forms a transition to the south Palæarctic
  sub-region. Perhaps on the whole the Indus may be taken as a convenient boundary. Many Indian
  naturalists, especially Mr. Blyth and Mr. Blanford, are impressed with the relations of the
  greater part of this sub-region to the Ethiopian region, and have proposed to divide it into
  several zoological districts dependent on differences of climate and vegetation, and characterized
  by possessing faunas more or less allied either to the Himalayan or the Ethiopian type. But these
  subdivisions appear far too complex to be useful to the general student, and even were they proved
  to be natural, would be beyond the scope of this work. I agree, however, with Mr. Elwes in
  thinking that they really belong to local rather than to geographical distribution, and confound
  "station" with "habitat." Wherever there is a marked diversity of surface and vegetation the
  productions of a country will correspondingly differ; the groups peculiar to forests, for example,
  will be absent from open <span class="pagenum" id="page322">{322}</span>plains or arid deserts. It
  happens that the three great Old World regions are separated from each other by a debatable land
  which is chiefly of a desert character; hence we must expect to find a resemblance between the
  inhabitants of such districts in each region. We also find a great resemblance between the aquatic
  birds of the three regions; and as we generally give little weight to these in our estimate of the
  degree of affinity of the faunas of different countries, so we should not count the desert fauna
  as of equal weight with the more restricted and peculiar types which are found in the fertile
  tracts,&mdash;in the mountains and valleys, and especially in the primeval forests. The supposed
  preponderance of exclusively Ethiopian groups of Mammalia and Birds in this, sub-region, deserves
  however a close examination, in order to ascertain how far the facts really warrant such an
  opinion.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The following list of the more important genera of Mammalia
  which range over the larger part of this sub-region will enable naturalists to form an independent
  judgment as to the preponderance of Ethiopian, or of Oriental and Palæarctic types, in this, the
  most important of all the classes of animals for geographical distribution.</p>

  <p>Out of the above 38 genera, 8 have so wide a distribution as to give no special geographical
  indications. Of the remaining 30, whose geographical position we have noted, 14 are Oriental only;
  5 have as much right to be considered Oriental as Ethiopian, extending as they do over the greater
  part of the Oriental region; 2 (the hyæna and gazelle) show Palæarctic rather than Ethiopian
  affinity; 7 are Palæarctic and Oriental but not Ethiopian; and only 2 (<i>Cynælurus</i> and
  <i>Mellivora</i>) can be considered as especially Ethiopian. We must also give due weight to the
  fact that we have here Ursidæ and Cervidæ, two families entirely absent from the Ethiopian region,
  and we shall then be forced to conclude that the affinities of the Indian peninsula are not only
  clearly Oriental, but that the Ethiopian element is really present in a far less degree than the
  Palæarctic.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The naturalists who have adopted the "Ethiopian theory" of the
  fauna of Hindostan, have always supported their views by an appeal to the class of birds;
  maintaining, that not only are almost all the characteristic Himalayan and Malayan genera absent,
  but that their place is to a great extent supplied by others which are characteristic of the
  Ethiopian region. After a careful examination of the subject, Mr. Elwes, in a paper read before
  the Zoological Society (June 1873) came to the conclusion, that this view was an erroneous one,
  founded on the fact that the birds of the plains are the more abundant and more <span
  class="pagenum" id="page324">{324}</span>open to observation; and that these are often of
  wide-spread types, and some few almost exclusively African. The facts he adduced do not, however,
  seem to have satisfied the objectors; and as the subject is an important one, I will here give
  lists of all the genera of Passeres, Picariæ, Psittaci, Columbæ, and Gallinæ, which inhabit the
  sub-region, leaving out those which only just enter within its boundaries from adjacent
  sub-regions. These are arranged under four heads:&mdash;1. Oriental genera; which are either
  wholly confined to, or strikingly prevalent in, the Oriental region beyond the limits of the

  Oriental or Palæarctic as Ethiopian, and cannot be held to prove any Ethiopian affinity. 3.
  Palæarctic genera; which are altogether or almost absent from the Ethiopian region. 4. Ethiopian
  genera; which are confined to, or very prevalent in, the Ethiopian region, whence they extend into

  be fairly balanced against those of the first list, in order to determine the character of the
  fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Thamnobia</i>, <i>Pyrrhulauda</i>, <i>Pterocles</i>, <i>Francolinus</i>;&mdash;4 genera.</p>

  <p>A consideration of the above lists shows us, that the Hindostan sub-region is by no means so
  poor in forms of bird-life as is generally supposed (and as I had myself anticipated, it would
  prove to be), possessing, as it does, 151 genera of land-birds, without counting the Accipitres.
  It must also set at rest the question of the zoological affinities of the district, since a
  preponderance of 88 genera, against 4, cannot be held to be insufficient, and cannot be materially
  altered by any corrections in details that may be proposed or substantiated. Even of these four,
  only the first two are exclusively Ethiopian, <i>Pterocles</i> and <i>Francolinus</i> both being
  Palæarctic also. It is a question, indeed, whether anywhere in the world an outlying sub-region
  can be found, exhibiting less zoological affinity for the adjacent regions; and we have here a
  striking illustration of the necessity of deciding all such cases, not by <i>examples</i>, which
  may be so chosen as to support any view, but by carefully weighing and contrasting the whole of
  the facts on which the solution of the <span class="pagenum" id="page326">{326}</span>problem
  admittedly depends. It will, perhaps, be said that a great many of the 88 genera above given are
  very scarce and very local; but this is certainly not the case with the majority of them; and even
  where it is so, that does not in any degree affect their value as indicating zoo-geographical
  affinities. It is the <i>presence</i> of a type in a region, not its abundance or scarcity, that
  is the important fact; and when we have to do, as we have here, with many groups whose habits and
  mode of life necessarily seclude them from observation, their supposed scarcity may not even be a
  fact.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Reptiles entirely agree with Mammalia and Birds in the main
  features of their distribution. Out of 17 families of snakes inhabiting Hindostan, 16 range over
  the greater part of the entire region, and only two can be supposed to show any Ethiopian
  affinity. These are the Psammophidæ and Erycidæ, both desert-haunting groups, and almost as much
  South Palæarctic as African. The genus <i>Tropidococcyx</i> is peculiar to the sub-region, and
  <i>Aspidura</i>, <i>Passerita</i> and <i>Cynophis</i> to the peninsula and Ceylon; while a large
  number of the most characteristic genera, as <i>Dipsas</i>, <i>Simotes</i>, <i>Bungarus</i>,
  <i>Naja</i>, <i>Trimeresurus</i>, <i>Lycodon</i> and <i>Python</i>, are characteristically
  Oriental.</p>

  <p>Of the six families of lizards all have a wide range. The genera <i>Eumeces</i>,
  <i>Pentadactylus</i>, <i>Gecko</i>, <i>Eublepharis</i>, and <i>Draco</i>, are characteristically
  or wholly Oriental; <i>Ophiops</i> and <i>Uromastix</i> are Palæarctic; while <i>Chamæleon</i> is
  the solitary case of decided Ethiopian affinity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of the Amphibia not a single family exhibits special Ethiopian affinities.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>II. Sub-region of Ceylon and South-India.</i></p>

  <p>The Island of Ceylon is characterised by such striking peculiarities in its animal productions,
  as to render necessary its separation from the peninsula of India as a sub-region; but it is found
  that most of these special features extend to the Neilgherries and the whole southern mountainous
  portion of India, and that the two must be united in any zoo-geographical <span class="pagenum"
  id="page327">{327}</span>province. The main features of this division are,&mdash;the appearance of
  numerous animals allied to forms only found again in the Himalayas or in the Malayan sub-region,
  the possession of several peculiar generic types, and an unusual number of peculiar species.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Among Mammalia the most remarkable form is <i>Loris</i>, a genus of
  Lemurs altogether peculiar to the sub-region; several peculiar monkeys of the genus
  <i>Presbytes</i>; the Malayan genus <i>Tupaia</i>; and <i>Platacanthomys</i>, a peculiar genus of
  Muridæ.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Among birds it has <i>Ochromela</i>, a peculiar genus of flycatchers;
  <i>Ph&#x0153;nicophaës</i> (Cuculidæ) and <i>Drymocataphus</i> (Timaliidæ), both Malayan forms; a
  species of <i>Myiophonus</i> whose nearest ally is in Java; <i>Trochalopteron</i>,
  <i>Brachypteryx</i>, <i>Buceros</i> and <i>Loriculus</i>, which are only found elsewhere in the
  Himalayas and Malayana. It also possesses about 80 peculiar species of birds, including a large
  jungle fowl, one owl and two hornbills.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;It is however by its Reptiles, even more than by its higher vertebrates,
  that this sub-region is clearly characterised. Among snakes it possesses an entire family,
  Uropeltidæ, consisting of 5 genera and 18 species altogether confined to
  it,&mdash;<i>Rhinophis</i> and <i>Uropeltis</i> in Ceylon, <i>Silybura</i>, <i>Plecturus</i> and
  <i>Melanophidium</i> in Southern India. Four other genera of snakes, <i>Haplocercus</i>,
  <i>Cercaspis</i>, <i>Peltopelor</i>, and <i>Hypnale</i> are also peculiar; <i>Chersydrus</i> is
  only found elsewhere in Malaya; while <i>Aspidura</i>, <i>Passerita</i>, and <i>Cynophis</i>, only
  extend to Hindostan; <span class="correction" title="&quot;and&quot; added by Errata">and</span>
  species of <i>Eryx</i>, <i>Echis</i>, and <i>Psammophis</i> show an affinity with Ethiopian and
  Palæarctic forms. Among lizards several genera of <i>Agamidæ</i> are peculiar, such as
  <i>Otocryptis</i>, <i>Lyricoephalus</i>, <i>Ceratophora</i>, <i>Cophotis</i>, <i>Salea</i>,
  <i>Sitana</i> and <i>Charasia</i>. In the family Acontiadæ, <i>Nessia</i> is peculiar to Ceylon,
  while a species of the African genus <i>Acontias</i> shows an affinity for the Ethiopian
  region.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;The genera of Amphibians that occur here are generally of wide range,
  but <i>Nannophrys</i>, <i>Haplobatrachus</i>, and <i>Cacopus</i> are confined to the sub-region;
  while <i>Megalophrys</i> is Malayan, and the species found in Ceylon also inhabit Java.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page328">{328}</span></div>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The insects of Ceylon also furnish some curious examples of its
  distinctness from Hindostan, and its affinity with Malaya. Among its butterflies we find
  <i>Papilio jophon</i>, closely allied to <i>P. antiphus</i> of Malaya. The remarkable genus
  <i>Hestia</i>, so characteristic of the Malay archipelago, only occurs elsewhere on the mountains
  of Ceylon; while its <i>Cynthia</i> and <i>Parthenos</i> are closely allied to, if not identical
  with, Malayan species. Among Coleoptera we have yet more striking examples. The highly
  characteristic Malayan genus <i>Tricondyla</i> is represented in Ceylon by no less than 10
  species; and among Longicorns we find the genera <i>Tetraommatus</i>, <i>Thranius</i>,
  <i>Cacia</i>, <i>Praonetha</i>, <i>Ropica</i>, and <i>Serixia</i>, all exclusively Malayan or only
  just entering the Indo-Chinese peninsula, yet all represented in Ceylon, while not a single
  species occurs in any part of India or the Himalayas.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>The Past History of Ceylon and South-India as indicated by its
  Fauna.</i>&mdash;In our account of the Ethiopian region we have already had occasion to refer to
  an ancient connection between this sub-region and Madagascar, in order to explain the distribution
  of the Lemurine type, and some other curious affinities between the two countries. This view is
  supported by the geology of India, which shows us Ceylon and South India consisting mainly of
  granitic and old metamorphic rocks, while the greater part of the peninsula, forming our first
  sub-region, is of tertiary formation, with a few isolated patches of secondary rocks. It is
  evident therefore, that during much of the tertiary period, Ceylon and South India were bounded on
  the north by a considerable extent of sea, and probably formed part of an extensive southern
  continent or great island. The very numerous and remarkable cases of affinity with Malaya, require
  however some closer approximation to these islands, which probably occurred at a later period.
  When, still later, the great plains and table-lands of Hindostan were formed, and a permanent land
  communication effected with the rich and highly developed Himalo-Chinese fauna, a rapid
  immigration of new types took place, and many of the less specialised forms of mammalia and birds
  (particularly those of ancient Ethiopian type) became extinct. Among reptiles and insects the
  competition was less severe, or the older forms were too well <span class="pagenum"
  id="page329">{329}</span>adapted to local conditions to be expelled; so that it is among these
  groups alone that we find any considerable number, of what are probably the remains of the ancient
  fauna of a now submerged southern continent.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>III. Himalayan or Indo-Chinese Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This, which is probably the richest of all the sub-regions, and perhaps one of the richest of
  all tracts of equal extent on the face of the globe, is essentially a forest-covered, mountainous
  country, mostly within the tropics, but on its northern margin extending some degrees beyond it,
  and rising in a continuous mountain range till it meets and intercalates with the Manchurian
  sub-division of the Palæarctic region. The peculiar mammalia, birds and insects of this sub-region
  begin to appear at the very foot of the Himalayas, but Dr. Gunther has shown that many of the
  reptiles characteristic of the plains of India are found to a height of from 2,000 to 4,000
  feet.</p>

  <p>In Sikhim, which may be taken as a typical example of the Himalayan portion of the sub-region,
  it seems to extend to an altitude of little less than 10,000 feet, that being the limit of the
  characteristic Timaliidæ or babbling thrushes; while the equally characteristic Pycnonotidæ, or
  bulbuls, and Treronidæ, or thick-billed fruit-pigeons, do not, according to Mr. Blanford, reach
  quite so high. We may perhaps take 9,000 feet as a good approximation over a large part of the
  Himalayan range; but it is evidently not possible to define the line with any great precision.
  Westward, the sub-region extends in diminishing breadth, till it terminates in or near Cashmere,
  where the fauna of the plains of India almost meets that of the Palæarctic region, at a moderate
  elevation. Eastward, it reaches into East Thibet and North-west China, where Père David has found
  a large number of the peculiar types of the Eastern Himalayas. A fauna, in general features
  identical, extends over Burmah and Siam to South China; mingling with the Palæarctic fauna in the
  mountains south of the Yang-tse-kiang river, and with that of Indo-Malaya in Tenasserim, and to a
  lesser extent in Southern Siam and Cochin China.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page330">{330}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Zoological Characteristics of the Himalayan Sub-region.</i>&mdash;Taking this
  sub-region as a whole, we find it to be characterised by 3 genera of mammalia (without counting
  bats), and 44 genera of land-birds, which are altogether peculiar to it; and by 13 genera of
  mammalia and 36 of birds, which it possesses in common with the Malayan sub-region; and besides
  these it has almost all the genera before enumerated as "Oriental," and several others of wide
  range, more especially a number of Palæarctic genera which appear in the higher Himalayas. The

  <p><i>Plate VII. Scene in Nepal, with Characteristic Himalayan Animals.</i>&mdash;Our illustration
  contains figures of two mammals and two birds, characteristic of the higher woody region of the
  Himalayas. The lower figure on the left is the <i>Helictis nepalensis</i>, confined to the Eastern
  Himalayas, and belonging to a genus of the weasel family which is exclusively Oriental. It is
  marked with white on a grey-brown ground. Above it is the remarkable Panda (<i>Ælurus
  fulgens</i>), a beautiful animal with a glossy fur of a reddish colour, darker feet, and a white
  somewhat cat-like face. It is distantly allied to the bears, and more nearly to the American
  racoons, yet with sufficient differences to constitute it a distinct family. The large bird on the
  tree, is the horned Tragopan (<i>Ceriornis satyra</i>), one of the fine Himalayan pheasants,
  magnificently spotted with red and white, and ornamented with fleshy erectile wattles and horns,
  of vivid blue and red colours. The bird in the foreground is the <i>Ibidorhynchus struthersii</i>,
  a rare and curious wader, allied to the curlews and sandpipers but having the bill and feet red.
  It frequents the river-beds in the higher Himalayas, but has also been found in Thibet.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Very few genera of reptiles are peculiar to this sub-region, all the
  more important ranging into the Malay islands. Of snakes the following are the more characteristic
  genera:&mdash;<i>Typhline</i>, <i>Cylindrophis</i>, <i>Xenopeltis</i>, <i>Calamaria</i>,
  <i>Xenelaphis</i>, <i>Hypsirhina</i>, <i>Fordonia</i>, several small genera of Homalopsidæ
  (<i>Herpeton</i> and <i>Hipistes</i> being characteristic of Burmah and Siam),
  <i>Psammodynastes</i>, <i>Gonyosoma</i>, <i>Chrysopelea</i>, <i>Tragops</i>, <i>Dipsas</i>,
  <i>Pareas</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Bungarus</i>, <i>Naja</i>, <i>Callophis</i>, and
  <i>Trimeresurus</i>. <i>Naja</i> reaches 8,000 feet elevation in the Himalayas,
  <i>Tropidonotus</i> 9,000 feet, <i>Ablabes</i> 10,000 feet, and <i>Simotes</i> 15,000 feet.</p>

  <p>Of lizards, <i>Pseudopus</i> has one species in the Khasya hills while the other inhabits
  South-east Europe; and there are two small genera of Agamidæ peculiar to the Himalayas, while
  <i>Draco</i> and <i>Calotes</i> have a wide range and <i>Acanthosaura</i>, <i>Dilophyrus</i>,
  <i>Physignathus</i>, and <i>Liolepis</i> are found chiefly in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. There
  are several genera of Scincidæ; and the extensive genus of wall-lizards, <i>Gecko</i>, ranges over
  the whole region.</p>

  <p>Of Amphibia, the peculiar forms are not numerous. <i><span class="correction"
  title="&quot;Icthyopsis&quot; in printed work, corrected
  by Errata">Ichthyophis</span></i> <span class="pagenum" id="page332">{332}</span>a genus of
  Ceciliadæ, is peculiar to the Khasya Hills; <i>Tylotritron</i> (Salamandridæ) to Yunan in Western
  China, and perhaps belongs to the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>Of the tail-less Batrachians, <i>Glyphoglossus</i> is found in Pegu; <i>Xenophys</i> in the
  Eastern Himalayas; while <i>Callula</i>, <i>Ixalus</i>, <i>Rhacophorus</i>, <i>Hylurana</i>,
  <i>Oxyglossus</i>, and <i>Phrynoglossus</i>, are common to the Himalo-Chinese and Malayan
  sub-regions.</p>

  <p>Of the lizards, <i>Colotes</i>, <i>Barycephalus</i>, and <i>Hinulia</i>,&mdash;and of the
  Batrachia, <i>Bufo</i>,&mdash;are found at above 11,000 feet elevation in the Himalayas.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;So little has been done in working out the insect faunas of the separate
  sub-regions, that they cannot be treated in detail, and the reader is referred to the chapter on
  the distribution of insects in the part of this work devoted to Geographical Zoology. A few
  particulars may, however, be given as to the butterflies, which have been more systematically
  collected in tropical countries than any other order of insects. The Himalayan butterflies,
  especially in the eastern portions of the range&mdash;in Assam and the Khasya Hills&mdash;are
  remarkably fine and very abundant; yet all the larger groups extend into the Malayan sub-region,
  many to Ceylon, and a considerable proportion even to Africa and Austro-Malaya. There are a large
  number of peculiar types, but most of them consist of few or single species. Such are
  <i>Neope</i>, <i>Orenoma</i>, and <i>Rhaphicera</i>, genera of Satyridæ; <i>Enispe</i> (Morphidæ);
  <i>Hestina</i>, <i>Penthema</i>, and <i>Abrota</i> (Nymphalidæ); <i>Dodona</i> (Erycinidæ);
  <i>Ilerda</i> (Lycænidæ); <i>Calinaga</i>, <i>Teinopalpus</i>, and <i>Bhutanitis</i>
  (Papilionidæ). Its more prominent features are, however, derived from what may be termed Malayan,
  or even Old World types, such as <i>Euplæa</i>, among Danaidæ; <i>Amathusia</i>, <i>Clerome</i>,
  and <i>Thaumantis</i>, among Morphidæ; <i>Euripus</i>, <i>Diadema</i>, <i>Athyma</i>,
  <i>Limenitis</i>, and <i>Adolias</i>, among Nymphalidæ; <i>Zemeros</i> and <i>Taxila</i> among
  Erycinidæ; <i>Amblypodia</i>, <i>Miletus</i>, <i>Ilerda</i>, and <i>Myrina</i>, among Lycænidæ;
  <i>Thyca</i>, <i>Prioneris</i>, <i>Dercas</i>, <i>Iphias</i>, and <i>Thestias</i> among Pieridæ;
  and Papilios of the "<i>Amphrisius</i>," "<i>Coon</i>", "<i>Philoxenus</i>," "<i>Protenor</i>,"
  "<i>Paris</i>," and "<i>Sarpedon</i>" groups. In the Himalayas there is an unusual abundance of
  large and gorgeous species of the genus <i>Papilio</i>, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page333">{333}</span>and of large and showy Nymphalidæ, Morphidæ, and Danaidæ, which render
  it, in favoured localities, only second to South America for a display of this form of beauty and
  variety in insect life.</p>

  <p>Among the other orders of insects in which the Himalayas are remarkably rich, we may mention
  large and brilliant Cetoniidæ, chiefly of the genus <i>Rhomborhima</i>; a magnificent Lamellicorn,
  <i>Euchirus macleayii</i>, allied to the gigantic long-armed beetle (<i>E. longimanus</i>) of
  Amboyna; superb moths of the families Agaristidæ and Sesiidæ; elegant and remarkable Fulgoridæ,
  and strange forms of the gigantic Phasmidæ; most of which appear to be of larger size or of more
  brilliant colours than their Malayan allies.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Islands of the Indo-Chinese Sub-region.</i>&mdash;A few important islands belong to this
  sub-region, the Andamans, Formosa, and Hainan being the most interesting.</p>

  <p><i>Andamans.</i>&mdash;The only mammalia are a few rats and mice, a <i>Paradoxurus</i>, and a
  pig supposed to be a hybrid race,&mdash;all of which may have been introduced by man's agency. The
  birds of the Andaman Islands have been largely collected, no less than 155 species having been
  obtained; and of these 17, (all land-birds) are peculiar. The genera are all found on the
  continent, and are mostly characteristic of the Indo-Chinese fauna, to which most of the species
  belong. Reptiles are also tolerably abundant; about 20 species are known, the majority being found
  also on the continent, while a few are peculiar. There are also a few Batrachia, and some
  fresh-water fishes, closely resembling those of Burmah. The absence of such mammalia as monkeys
  and squirrels, which abound on the mainland, and which are easily carried over straits or narrow
  seas by floating trees, is sufficient proof that these islands have not recently formed part of
  the continent. The birds are mostly such as may have reached the islands while in their present
  geographical position; and the occurrence of reptiles and fresh-water fishes, said to be identical
  in species with those of Burmah, must be due to the facilities, which some of these animals
  undoubtedly <span class="pagenum" id="page334">{334}</span>possess, for passing over a
  considerable width of sea. We must conclude, therefore, that these islands do not owe their
  existing fauna to an actual union with the mainland; but it is probable that they may have been
  formerly more extensive, and have then been less distant from the continent than at the present
  time.</p>

  <p>The Nicobar Islands, usually associated with the Andamans, are less known, but present somewhat
  similar phenomena. They are, however, more Malayan in their fauna, and seem properly to belong to
  the Indo-Malay sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Formosa.</i>&mdash;This island has been carefully examined by Mr. Swinhoe, who found 144
  species of birds, of which 34 are peculiar. There is one peculiar genus, but the rest are all
  Indo-Chinese, though some of the species are more allied to Malayan than to Chinese or Himalayan
  forms. About 30 species of mammalia were found in Formosa, of which 11 are peculiar species, the
  rest being either Chinese or Himalayan. The peculiar species belong to the genera <i>Talpa</i>,
  <i>Helictis</i>, <i>Sciuropterus</i>, <i>Pteromys</i>, <i>Mus</i>, <i>Sus</i>, <i>Cervus</i>, and
  <i>Capricornis</i>. A few lizards and snakes of continental species have also been found. These
  facts clearly indicate the former connection of Formosa with China and Malaya, a connection which
  is rendered the more probable by the shallow sea which still connects all these countries.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Hainan.</i>&mdash;The island of Hainan, on the south coast of China, is not so
  well known in proportion, though Mr. Swinhoe collected 172 species of birds, of which 130 were
  land-birds. Of these about 20 were peculiar species; the remainder being either Chinese,
  Himalayan, or Indo-Malayan. Mr. Swinhoe also obtained 24 species of mammalia, all being Chinese,
  Himalayan, or Indo-Malayan species except a hare, which is peculiar. This assemblage of animals
  would imply that Hainan, as might be anticipated from its position, has been more recently
  separated from the continent than the more distant island of Formosa.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>IV. Indo-Malaya, or the Malayan Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>This sub-region, which is almost wholly insular (including only the Malayan peninsula on the
  continent of Asia), is equal, if <span class="pagenum" id="page335">{335}</span>not superior, in
  the variety and beauty of its productions, to that which we have just been considering. Like
  Indo-China, it is a region of forests, but it is more exclusively tropical; and it is therefore
  deficient in many of those curious forms of the temperate zone of the Himalayas, which seem to
  have been developed from Palæarctic rather than from Oriental types. Here alone, in the Oriental
  region, are found the most typical equatorial forms of life&mdash;organisms adapted to a climate
  characterised by uniform but not excessive heat, abundant moisture, and no marked departure from
  the average meteorological state, throughout the year. These favourable conditions of life only
  occur in three widely separated districts of the globe&mdash;the Malay archipelago, Western
  Africa, and equatorial South America. Hence perhaps it is, that the tapir and the trogons of
  Malacca should so closely resemble those of South America; and that the great anthropoid apes and
  crested hornbills of Western Africa, should find their nearest allies in Borneo and Sumatra.</p>

  <p>Although the islands which go to form this sub-region are often separated from each other by a
  considerable expanse of sea, yet their productions in general offer no greater differences than
  those of portions of the Indo-Chinese sub-region separated by an equal extent of dry land. The
  explanation is easy, however, when we find that the sea which separates them is a very shallow
  one, so shallow that an elevation of only 300 feet would unite Sumatra, Java, and Borneo into one
  great South-eastern prolongation of the Asiatic continent. As we know that our own country has
  been elevated and depressed to a greater amount than this, at least twice in recent geological
  times, we can have no difficulty in admitting similar changes of level in the Malay archipelago,
  where the subterranean forces which bring about such changes are still at work, as manifested by
  the great chain of active volcanoes in Sumatra and Java. Proofs of somewhat earlier changes of
  level are to be seen in the Tertiary coal formations of Borneo, which demonstrate a succession of
  elevations and subsidences, with as much certainty as if we had historical record of them.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to suppose, nor is it probable, that all these <span class="pagenum"
  id="page336">{336}</span>great islands were recently united to the continent, and that their
  separation took place by one general subsidence of the whole. It is more consonant with what we
  know of such matters, that the elevations and depressions were partial, varying in their points of
  action and often recurring; sometimes extending one part of an island, sometimes another; now
  joining an island to the main land, now bringing two islands into closer proximity. There is
  reason to believe that sometimes an intervening island has sunk or receded and allowed others
  which it before separated to effect a partial union independently of it. If we recognise the
  probability that such varied and often-renewed changes of level have occurred, we shall be better
  able to understand how certain anomalies of distribution in these islands may have been brought
  about. We will now endeavour to sketch the general features of the zoology of this interesting
  district, and then proceed to discuss some of the relations of the islands to each other.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;We have seen that the Indo-Chinese sub-region possesses 13
  species of mammalia in common with the Indo-Malay sub-region, and 4 others peculiar to itself,
  besides one Ethiopian and several Oriental and Palæarctic forms of wide range. Of this latter
  class the Malay islands have comparatively few, but they possess no less than 14 peculiar genera,
  viz. <i>Simia</i>, <i>Siamanga</i>, <i>Tarsius</i>, <i>Galeopithecus</i>, <i>Hylomys</i>,
  <i>Ptilocerus</i>, <i>Gymnura</i>, <i>Cynogale</i>, <i>Hemigalea</i>, <i>Arctogale</i>,
  <i>Barangia</i>, <i>Mydaus</i>, <i>Helarctos</i>, and <i>Tapirus</i>. The islands also possess
  tigers, deer, wild pigs, wild cattle, elephants, the scaly ant-eater, and most of the usual
  Oriental genera; so that they are on the whole fully as rich as, if not richer than, any part of
  Asia; a fact very unusual in island faunas, and very suggestive of their really continental
  nature.</p>

  <p><i>Plate VIII. Scene in Borneo with Characteristic Malayan Quadrupeds.</i>&mdash;The Malayan
  fauna is so rich and peculiar that we devote two plates to illustrate it. We have here a group of
  mammalia, such as might be seen together in the vast forests of Borneo. In the foreground we have
  the beautiful deer-like Chevrotain (<i>Tragulus javanicus</i>). These are delicate little animals
  whose body is not larger than a rabbit's, thence often called "mouse-deer." They were formerly
  classed with the "musk-deer," owing to their similar tusk-like upper canines; but their anatomy
  shows them to form quite a distinct family, having more resemblance to the camels. On the branch
  above is the curious feather-tailed Tree-Shrew (<i>Ptilocerus lowii</i>), a small insectivorous
  animal altogether peculiar to Borneo. Above this is the strange little Tarsier (<i>Tarsius
  spectrum</i>), one of the lemurs confined to the Malay islands, but so distinct from all others as
  to constitute a separate family. The other small animals are the Flying Lemurs (<i>Galæopithecus
  volans</i>) formerly classed with the lemurs, but now considered to belong to the Insectivora.
  They have a very large expansion of the skin connecting the fore and hind limbs and tail, and are
  able to take long flights from one tree to another, and even to rise over obstacles in their
  course by the elevatory power of the tail-membrane. They feed chiefly on leaves, and have a very
  soft and beautifully marbled fur.</p>

  <p>In the distance is the Malayan tapir (<i>Tapirus indicus</i>), a representative of a group of
  animals now confined to the larger Malay islands and tropical America, but which once ranged over
  the greater part of temperate Europe.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Owing to several of the families consisting of very obscure and closely
  allied species, which have never been critically examined and compared by a competent
  ornithologist, the number of birds inhabiting this sub-region is uncertain. From the best
  available materials there appear to be somewhat less than 650 species of land-birds actually
  known, or excluding the Philippine Islands somewhat less than 600. The larger part of these are
  peculiar species, but mostly allied to those of Indo-China; 36 of the genera, as already stated,
  being common to these two sub-regions. There are, however, no less than 46 genera which are
  peculiarly or wholly Indo Malayan and, in many cases, have no close affinity with other Oriental
  groups. These peculiar genera are as follows:&mdash;<i>Timalia</i>, <i>Malacopteron</i>,
  <i>Macronus</i>, <i>Napothera</i>, <i>Turdinus</i>, and <i>Trichixos</i>&mdash;genera <span
  class="pagenum" id="page338">{338}</span>of Timaliidæ; <i>Eupetes</i>, a most remarkable form,
  perhaps allied to <i>Enicurus</i>, and <i>Cinclus</i>; <i>Rhabdornis</i> (Certhiidæ) found only in
  the Philippines; <i>Psaltria</i>, a diminutive bird of doubtful affinities, provisionally classed
  among the tits (Paridæ); <i>Setornis</i> (Pycnonotidæ); <i>Lalage</i> (Campephagidæ) extending
  eastward to the Pacific Islands; <i>Pycnosphrys</i>, <i>Philentoma</i> (Muscicapidæ);
  <i>Laniellus</i>, a beautiful bird doubtfully classed with the shrikes (Laniidæ);
  <i>Platylophus</i> and <i>Pityriasis</i>, the latter a most anomalous form&mdash;perhaps a
  distinct family, at present classed with the jays, in Corvidæ; <i>Prionochilus</i>, a curious form
  classed with Dicæidæ; <i>Erythrura</i> (Ploceidæ), extending eastwards to the Fiji Islands;
  <i>Gymnops</i>, <i>Calornis</i>, (Sturnidæ); <i>Eurylæmus</i>, <i>Corydon</i>, and
  <i>Calyptomena</i> (Eurylæmidæ); <i>Eucichla</i>, the longest tailed and most elegantly marked of
  the Pittidæ; <i>Reinwardtipicus</i> and <i>Miglyptes</i> (Picidæ); <i>Psilopogon</i> and
  <i>Calorhamphus</i>, (Megalæmidæ); <i>Rhinococcyx</i>, <i>Dasylophus</i>, <i>Lepidogrammus</i>,
  <i>Carpococcyx</i>, <i>Zanclostomus</i>, <i>Poliococcyx</i>, <i>Rhinortha</i>, (Cuculidæ);
  <i>Berenicornis</i>, <i>Caldo</i>, <i>Cranorhinus</i>, <i>Penelopides</i>, <i>Rhinoplax</i>,
  (Bucerotidæ); <i>Psittinus</i>, (Psittacidæ); <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Phapitreron</i>, (Columbidæ);
  <i>Rollulus</i>, (Treronidæ); <i>Machærhamphus</i>, (Falconidæ). Many of these genera are abundant
  and wide-spread, while some of the most characteristic Himalayan genera, such as <i>Larvivora</i>,
  <i>Garrulax</i>, <i>Hypsipetes</i>, <i>Pomatorhinus</i>, and <i>Dendrocitta</i>, are here
  represented by only a few species.</p>

  <p>Among the groups that are characteristic of the Malayan sub-region, the Timaliidæ and
  Pycnonotidæ stand pre-eminent; the former represented chiefly by the genera <i>Timalia</i>,
  <i>Malacopteron</i>, <i>Macronus</i>, and <i>Trichastoma</i>, the latter by <i>Criniger</i>,
  <i>Microscelis</i>, and many forms of <i>Pycnonotus</i>. The Muscicapidæ, Dicruridæ, Campephagidæ,
  Ploceidæ, and Nectariniidæ are also well developed; as well as the Pittidæ, and the Eurylæmidæ,
  the limited number of species of the latter being compensated by a tolerable abundance of
  individuals. Among the Picariæ are many conspicuous groups; as, woodpeckers (Picidæ); barbets
  (Megalæmidæ); trogons (Trogonidæ); kingfishers (Alcedinidæ); and hornbills (Bucerotidæ); five
  families which are perhaps the most conspicuous in the whole fauna. Lastly come the pigeons <span
  class="pagenum" id="page339">{339}</span>(Columbidæ), and the pheasants (Phasianidæ), which are
  fairly represented by such fine genera as <i>Treron</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Euplocamus</i>, and
  <i>Argusianus</i>. A few forms whose affinities are Australian rather than Oriental, help to give
  a character to the ornithology, though none of them are numerous. The swallow-shrikes
  (<i>Artamus</i>); the wag-tail fly-catchers (<i>Rhipidura</i>); the green fruit-doves
  (<i>Ptilopus</i>); and the mound-makers (<i>Megapodius</i>), are the chief of these.</p>

  <p>There are a few curious examples of remote geographical alliances that may be noted. First, we
  have a direct African connection in <i>Machærhamphus</i>, a genus of hawks, and
  <i>Berenicornis</i>, a genus of hornbills; the only close allies being, in the former case in
  South, and in the latter in West Africa. Then we have a curious Neotropical affinity, indicated by
  <i>Carpococcyx</i>, a large Bornean ground-cuckoo, whose nearest ally is the genus
  <i>Neomorphus</i> of South America; and by the lovely green-coloured <i>Calyptomena</i> which
  seems unmistakably allied to the orange-coloured <i>Rupicola</i>, or "Cock of the rock," in
  general structure and in the remarkable form of crest, a resemblance which has been noticed by
  many writers.</p>

  <p>In the preceding enumeration of Malayan genera several are included which extend into the
  Austro-Malay Islands, our object, at present, being to show the differences and relations of the
  two chief Oriental sub-regions.</p>

  <p><i>Plate IX. A Malayan Forest with some of its peculiar Birds.</i>&mdash;Our second
  illustration of the Malayan fauna is devoted to its bird-life; and for this purpose we place our
  scene in the Malay peninsula, where birds are perhaps more abundant and more interesting, than in
  any other part of the sub-region. Conspicuous in the foreground is the huge Rhinoceros Hornbill
  (<i>Buceros rhinoceros</i>), one of the most characteristic birds of the Malayan forests, the
  flapping of whose wings, as it violently beats the air to support its heavy body, may be heard a
  mile off. On the ground behind, is the Argus pheasant (<i>Argusianus giganteus</i>) whose
  beautifully ocellated wings have been the subject of a most interesting description in Mr.
  Darwin's <i>Descent of Man</i>. The wing-feathers are here so enormously <span class="pagenum"
  id="page340">{340}</span>developed for display (as shown in our figure) that they become almost,
  if not quite, useless for their original purpose of flight; yet the colours are so sober,
  harmonizing completely with the surrounding vegetation, and the bird is so wary, that in the
  forests where it abounds an old hunter assured me he had never been able to see a specimen till it
  was caught in his snares. It is interesting to note, that during the display of the plumage the
  bird's head is concealed by the wings from a spectator in front, and, contrary to what usually
  obtains among pheasants, the head is entirely unadorned, having neither crest nor a particle of
  vivid colour,&mdash;a remarkable confirmation of Mr. Darwin's views, that gayly coloured plumes
  are developed in the male bird for the purpose of attractive display in the breeding season. The
  long-tailed bird on the right is one of the Drongo-shrikes (<i><span class="correction"
  title="&quot;Edolius&quot; in printed work, corrected by
  Errata">Bhringa</span> remifer</i>), whose long bare tail-feathers, with an oar-like web at the
  end, and blue-black glossy plumage, render it a very attractive object as it flies after its
  insect prey. On the left is another singular bird the great Broad-bill (<i>Corydon
  sumatranus</i>), with dull and sombre plumage, but with a beak more like that of a boat-bill than
  of a fruit-eating passerine bird. Over all, the white-handed Gibbon (<i>Hylobates lar</i>) swings
  and gambols among the topmost branches of the forest.</p>

  <p class="sp4"><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;These are not sufficiently known to be of much
  use for our present purpose. Most of the genera belong to the continental parts of the Oriental
  region, or have a wide range. Of snakes <i>Rhabdosoma</i>, <i>Typhlocalamus</i>,
  <i>Tetragonosoma</i>, <i>Acrochordus</i>, and <i>Atropos</i>, are the most peculiar, and there are
  several peculiar genera of Homalopsidæ. Of Oriental genera, <i>Cylindrophis</i>,
  <i>Xenopeltes</i>, <i>Calamaria</i>, <i>Hypsirhina</i>, <i>Psammodynastes</i>, <i>Gonyosoma</i>,
  <i>Tragops</i>, <i>Dipsas</i>, <i>Pareas</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Bungarus</i>, <i>Naja</i>, and
  <i>Callophis</i> are abundant; as well as <i>Simotes</i>, <i>Ablabes</i>, <i>Tropidonotus</i>, and
  <i>Dendrophis</i>, which are widely distributed. Among lizards <i>Hydrosaurus</i> and <i>Gecko</i>
  are common; there are many isolated groups of Scincidæ; while <i>Draco</i>, <i>Calotes</i>, and
  many forms of Agamidæ, some of which are peculiar, abound.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page341">{341}</span></div>

  <p>Among the Amphibia, toads and frogs of the genera <i>Micrhyla</i>, <i>Kalophrynus</i>,
  <i>Ansonia</i>, and <i>Pseudobufo</i>, are peculiar: while the Oriental <i>Megalophrys</i>,
  <i>Ixalus</i>, <i>Rhacophorus</i>, and <i>Hylorana</i> are abundant and characteristic.</p>

  <p><i>Fishes.</i>&mdash;The fresh-water fishes of the Malay archipelago have been so well
  collected and examined by the Dutch naturalists, that they offer valuable indications of
  zoo-geographical affinity; and they particularly well exhibit the sharply defined limits of the
  region, a large number of Oriental and even Ethiopian genera extending eastward as far as Java and
  Borneo, but very rarely indeed sending a single species further east, to Celebes or the Moluccas.
  Thirteen families of fresh-water fishes are found in the Indo-Malay sub-region. Of these the
  Scienidæ and Symbranchidæ have mostly a wide range in the tropics. Ophiocephalidæ are exclusively
  Oriental, reaching Borneo and the Philippine islands. The Mastacembelidæ are also Oriental, but
  one species is found as far as Ceram. Of the Nandidæ, 3 genera range over the whole region. The
  Labyrinthici extend from Africa through the Oriental region to Amboyna, The single species
  constituting the family Luciocephalidæ is confined to Borneo and the small islands of Biliton and
  Banca. Of the extensive family Siluridæ 17 genera are Oriental and Malayan, and 11 are Malayan
  exclusively; and not one of these appears to pass beyond the limits of the sub-region. The
  Cyprinidæ offer an equally striking example, 23 genera ranging eastward to Java and Borneo and not
  one beyond; 14 of these being exclusively Malayan. It must be remembered that this is not from any
  want of knowledge of the countries farther east, as extensive collections have also been made in
  Celebes, the Moluccas, and Timor; so that the facts of distribution of fresh-water fishes come,
  most unexpectedly, to fortify that division of the archipelago into two primary regions, which was
  founded on a consideration of mammalia and birds only.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Few countries in the world can present a richer and more varied series of
  insects than the Indo-Malay islands, and we can only here notice a few of their more striking
  peculiarities and more salient features.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page342">{342}</span></div>

  <p>The butterflies of this sub-region, according to the best estimate that can be formed, amount
  to about 650 described species, a number that will yet, no doubt, be very considerably increased.
  The genera which appear to be peculiar to it are <i>Erites</i> (Satyridæ); <i>Zeuxidia</i>
  (Morphidæ); <i>Amnosia</i>, <i>Xanthotænia</i>, and <i>Tanæcia</i> (Nymphalidæ). The groups which
  are most characteristic of the region, either from their abundance in individuals or species, or
  from their size and beauty, are&mdash;the rich dark-coloured <i>Euplæa</i>; the large
  semi-transparent <i>Hestia</i>; the plain-coloured <i>Mycalesis</i>, which replace our
  meadow-brown butterflies (<i>Hipparchia</i>); the curious <i>Elymnias</i>, which often closely
  resemble Euplæas; the large and handsome <i>Thamantis</i> and <i>Zeuxidia</i>, which take the
  place of the giant Morphos of South America; the <i>Cethosia</i>, of the brightest red, and marked
  with a curious zigzag pattern; the velvety and blue-glossed <i>Terinos</i>; the pale and
  delicately-streaked <i>Cyrestis</i>; the thick-bodied and boldly coloured <i>Adolias</i>; the
  small wine-coloured <i>Taxila</i>; the fine blue <i>Amblypodia</i>; the beautiful <i>Thyca</i>,
  elegantly marked underneath with red and yellow, which represent our common white butterflies and
  are almost equally abundant; the pale blue <i>Eronia</i>, and the large red-tipped <i>Iphias</i>.
  The genus <i>Papilio</i> is represented by a variety of fine groups; the large
  <i>Ornithoptera</i>, with satiny yellow under-wings; the superb green-marked "<i>brookeana</i>;"
  the "<i>paradoxa</i>" group, often closely resembling the Euplæas that abound in the same
  district; the "<i>paris</i>" group richly dusted with golden-green specks; the "<i>helenus</i>"
  group with wide-spreading black and white wings; the black and crimson "<i>polydorus</i>" group;
  the "<i>memnon</i>" group, of the largest size and richly-varied colours; and the
  "<i>eurypilus</i>" group, elegantly banded or spotted with blue or green: all these are so
  abundant that some of them are met with in every walk, and are a constant delight to the
  naturalist who has the privilege of observing them in their native haunts.</p>

  <p>The Coleoptera are far less prominent and require to be carefully sought after; but they then
  well repay the collector. As affording some measure of the productiveness of the tropics in insect
  life it will not be out of place to give a few notes of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page343">{343}</span>number of species collected by myself in some of the best localities. At
  Singapore 300 species of Coleoptera were collected in 15 days, and in a month the number had
  increased to 520; of which 100 were Longicorns and 140 Rhyncophora. At Sarawak in Borneo I
  obtained 400 species in 15 days, and 600 in a month. In two months this number had increased to
  about 850, and in three months to 1,000 species. This was the most prolific spot I ever collected
  in, especially for Longicorns which formed about one-fifth of all the species of beetles. In the
  Aru Islands in one month, I obtained only 235 species of Coleoptera, and about 600 species of
  insects of all orders; and this may be taken as a fair average, in localities where no specially
  favourable conditions existed. On the average 40 to 60 species of Coleoptera would be a good day's
  collecting; 70 exceptionally good; while the largest number ever obtained in one day was 95, and
  the majority of these would be very minute insects. It must be remembered, however, that many very
  common species were passed over, yet had every species met with been collected, not much more than
  100 species would ever have been obtained in one day's collecting of four or five hours. These
  details may afford an interesting standard of comparison for collectors in other parts of the
  world.</p>

  <p>Of Cicindelidæ the most peculiarly Malayan form is <i>Therates</i>, found always on leaves in
  the forests in the same localities as the more widely spread <i>Collyris</i>. Five genera of this
  family are Indo-Malayan.</p>

  <p>The Carabidæ, though sufficiently plentiful, are mostly of small size, and not conspicuous in
  any way. But there is one striking exception in the purely Malayan genus <i>Mormolyce</i>, the
  largest and most remarkable of the whole family. It is nocturnal, resting during the days on the
  under side of large <i>boleti</i> in the virgin forest. <i>Pericallus</i> and <i>Catascopus</i>
  are among the few genera which are at all brillantly coloured.</p>

  <p>Buprestidæ are abundant, and very gay; the genus <i>Belionota</i> being perhaps one of the most
  conspicuous and characteristic. The giant <i>Catoxantha</i> is, however, the most peculiar, though
  comparatively scarce. <i>Chrysochroa</i> and <i>Chalcophora</i> are also <span class="pagenum"
  id="page344">{344}</span>abundant and characteristic. Out of the 41 Oriental genera 21 are
  Malayan, and 10 of these are not found in the other sub-regions.</p>

  <p>In Lucanidæ the Malay islands are rich, 14 out of the 16 Oriental genera occurring there, and 3
  being peculiar. There are many fine species of <i>Odontolabris</i>, which may be considered the
  characteristic genus of the sub-region.</p>

  <p>The Cetoniidæ are well represented by 16 genera and about 120 species. The genera
  <i>Mycteristes</i>, <i>Phædimus</i>, <i>Plectrone</i>, <i>Euremina</i>, <i>Rhagopteryx</i> and
  <i>Centrognathus</i> are peculiar, while <i>Agestrata</i>, <i>Chalcothea</i>, and <i>Macronota</i>
  are abundant and characteristic.</p>

  <p>The Longicorns, as in all continental forest regions near the equator, are very abundant and in
  endlessly varied forms. No less than 55 genera containing about 200 species are peculiar to this
  sub-region, the Cerambycidæ being much the most numerous. <i>Euryarthrum</i>,
  <i>C&#x0153;losterna</i>, <i>Agelasta</i>, and <i>Astathes</i> may be considered as most
  characteristic; but to name the curious and interesting forms would be to give a list of half the
  genera. For the relations of the Longicorns of the Indo-Malay, and those of the Austro-Malay
  region, the reader is referred to the chapter on the distribution of insects in the succeeding
  part of this work.</p>

  <p><i>Terrestrial Mollusca.</i>&mdash;The Philippine islands are celebrated as being one of the
  richest parts of the world for land shells, about 400 species being known. The other islands of
  the sub-region are far less rich, not more than about 100 species having yet been described from
  the whole of them. <i>Helix</i> and <i>Bulimus</i> both abound in species in the Philippines,
  whereas the latter genus is very scarce in Borneo and Java. Ten genera of Helicidæ inhabit the
  sub-region; <i>Pfeifferia</i> is found in the Philippines and Moluccas, while the large genus
  <i>Cochlostyla</i> is almost peculiar to the Philippines. Of the Operculata there are
  representatives of 20 genera, of which <i>Dermatoma</i> and <i>Pupinella</i> are peculiar, while
  <i>Registoma</i> and <i>Callia</i> extend to the Australian region. <i>Cyclophorus</i>,
  <i>Leptopoma</i>, and <i>Pupina</i> are perhaps the most characteristic genera.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>The Zoological Relations of the Several Islands of the Indo-Malay
  Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>Although we have grouped the Philippine islands with the Indo-Malay sub-region, to which, as we
  shall see, they undoubtedly belong, yet most of the zoological characteristics we have just
  sketched out, apply more especially to the other groups of islands and the Malay peninsula. The
  Philippine islands stand, to Malaya proper, in the same relation that Madagascar does to Africa or
  the Antilles to South America; that is, they are remarkable for the absence of whole families and
  genera which everywhere characterise the remainder of the district. They are, in fact, truly
  insular, while the other islands are really continental in all the essential features of their
  natural history. Before, therefore, we can conveniently compare the separate islands of Malaya<a
  id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> with each other, we must first deal with the
  Philippine group, showing in what its speciality consists, and why it must be considered apart
  from the sub-region to which it belongs.</p>

  <p>The foregoing list, although small, contains an assemblage of species which are wholly Oriental
  in character, and several of which (<i>Tarsius</i>, <i>Galeopithecus</i>, <i>Tupaia</i>) are
  characteristic and highly peculiar Malayan forms. At the same time these islands are completely
  separated from the rest of Malaya by the total absence of <i>Semnopithecus</i>, <i>Hylobates</i>,
  <i>Felis</i>, <i>Helarctos</i>, <i>Rhinoceros</i>, <i>Manis</i>, and other groups constantly found
  in the great Indo-Malay islands and peninsula of Malacca. We find apparently two sets of animals:
  a more ancient series, represented by the deer, <i>Galeopithecus</i>, and squirrel, in which the
  species are distinct from any others; and a more recent series, represented by <i>Macacus
  cynomolgus</i>, and <i>Viverra tangalunga</i>, identical with common Malayan animals. The former
  indicate the earliest period when these volcanic islands were connected with some part of the
  Malayan sub-region, and they show that this was not geologically remote, since no peculiar generic
  types have been preserved or differentiated. The latter may indicate either the termination of the
  period of union, or merely the effects of introduction by man. The reason why a larger number of
  mammalian forms were not introduced and established, was probably because the union was effected
  only with some small islands, and from these communicated to other parts of the archipelago; or it
  may well be that later subsidences extinguished some of the forms that had established
  themselves.</p>

  <p><i>Birds of the Philippine Islands.</i>&mdash;These have been carefully investigated by
  Viscount Walden, in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London in 1873, and we are thus
  furnished with ample information on the relations of this important portion of the fauna.</p>

  <p>The total number of birds known to inhabit the Philippines is 219, of which 106 are peculiar.
  If, however, following our usual plan, we take only the land-birds, we find the numbers to be 159
  species, of which 100 are peculiar; an unusually large proportion for a group of islands so
  comparatively near to various parts of the Oriental and Australian regions. The families of birds
  which are more especially characteristic of the Indo-Malay sub-region are about 28 in number, and
  examples <span class="pagenum" id="page347">{347}</span>of all these are found in the Philippines
  except four, viz., Cinclidæ, Phyllornithidæ, Eurylæmidæ, and Podargidæ. The only Philippine
  families which are, otherwise, exclusively Austro-Malayan are, Cacatuidæ and Megapodiidæ. Yet
  although the birds are unmistakably Malayan, as a whole, there are, as in the mammalia (though in
  a less degree), marked deficiencies of most characteristic Malayan forms. Lord Walden gives a list
  of no less than 69 genera thus absent; but it will be sufficient here to mention such wide-spread
  and specially Indo-Malay groups as,&mdash;<i>Eurylæmus</i>, <i>Nyctiornis</i>,
  <i>Arachnothera</i>, <i>Geocichla</i>, <i>Malacopteron</i>, <i>Timalia</i>, <i>Pomatorhinus</i>,
  <i>Phyllornis</i>, <i>Iora</i>, <i>Criniger</i>, <i>Enicurus</i>, <i>Chaptia</i>, <i>Tchitrea</i>,
  <i>Dendrocitta</i>, <i>Eulabes</i>, <i>Palæornis</i>, <i>Miglyptes</i>, <i>Tiga</i>, and
  <i>Euplocamus</i>. These deficiencies plainly show the isolated character of the Philippine group,
  and imply that it has never formed a part of that Indo-Malayan extension of the continent which
  almost certainly existed when the peculiar Malayan fauna was developed; or that, if it has been so
  united, it has been subsequently submerged and broken up to such an extent, as to cause the
  extinction of many of the absent types.</p>

  <p>It appears from Lord Walden's careful analysis, that 31 of the Philippine species occur in the
  Papuan sub-region, and 47 in Celebes; 69 occur also in India, and 75 in Java. This last fact is
  curious, since Java is the most remote of the Malayan islands, but it is found to arise almost
  wholly from the birds of that island being better known, since only one species, <i>Xantholæma
  rosea</i>, is confined to the Philippine Islands and Java.</p>

  <p>The wading and swimming birds are mostly of wide-spread forms, only 6 out of the 60 species
  being peculiar to the Philippine archipelago. Confining ourselves to the land-birds, and combining
  several of the minutely subdivided genera of Lord Walden's paper so as to agree with the
  arrangement adopted in this work, we find that there are 112 genera of land-birds represented in
  the islands. Of these, 50 are either cosmopolitan, of wide range, or common to the Oriental and
  Australian regions, and may be put aside as affording few indications of geographical affinity. Of
  the remaining 62 no less than 40 are exclusively <span class="pagenum" id="page348">{348}</span>or
  mainly Oriental, and most of them are genera which range widely over the region, only two
  (<i>Philentoma</i> and <i>Rollulus</i>) being exclusively Malayan, and two others
  (<i>Megalurus</i> and <i>Malacocircus</i>) more especially Indian or continental. Five other
  genera, though having a wide range, are typically Palæarctic, and have reached the islands through
  North China. They are, <i>Monticola</i>, <i>Acrocephalus</i>, <i>Phylloscopus</i>,
  <i>Calliope</i>, and <i>Passer</i>; the two first having extended their range southward into the
  Moluccas. The peculiarly Australian genera are only 12, the majority being characteristic Papuan
  and Moluccan forms; such as&mdash;<i>Campephaga</i>, <i>Alcyone</i>, <i>Cacatua</i>,
  <i>Tanygnathus</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Janthænas</i>, <i>&lt;Phlogænas</i>, and
  <i>Megapodius</i>. One is peculiar to Celebes (<i>Prioniturus</i>); one to the Papuan group
  (<i>Cyclopsitta</i>); and one is chiefly Australian (<i>Gerygone</i>). The beautiful little
  parroquets forming the genus <i>Loriculus</i>, are characteristic of the Philippines, which
  possess 5 species, a larger number than occurs in any other group of islands, though they range
  from India to <span class="correction" title="&quot;Flores&quot; in printed work, corrected by
  Errata">New Guinea</span>. There remain six peculiar genera&mdash;<i>Rhabdornis</i>, an isolated
  form of creepers (Certhiidæ); <i>Gymnops</i>, a remarkable bareheaded bird belonging to the
  starlings (Sturnidæ); <i>Dasylophus</i>, and <i>Lepidogrammus</i>, remarkable genera of cuckoos
  (Cuculidæ); <i>Penelopides</i>, a peculiar hornbill, and <i>Phapitreron</i>, a genus of pigeons.
  Besides these there are four other types (here classed as sub-genera, but considered to be
  distinct by Lord Walden) which are peculiar to the Philippines. These are <i>Pseudoptynx</i>, an
  owl of the genus <i>Athene</i>; <i>Pseudolalage</i>, a sub-genus of <i>Lalage</i>;
  <i>Zeocephus</i>, a sub-genus of <i>Tchitrea</i>; and <i>Ptilocolpa</i>, included under
  <i>Carpophaga</i>.</p>

  <p>When we look at the position of the Philippine group, connected by the Bashee islands with
  Formosa, by Palawan and the Sooloo archipelago with Borneo, and by the Tulour and other islets
  with the Moluccas and Celebes, we have little difficulty in accounting for the peculiarities of
  its bird fauna. The absence of a large number of Malayan groups would indicate that the actual
  connection with Borneo, which seems necessary for the introduction of the Malay types of mammalia,
  was not of long duration; while the large proportion of wide-spread continental genera of birds
  would seem to imply that greater facilities had <span class="pagenum"
  id="page349">{349}</span>once existed for immigration from Southern China, perhaps by a land
  connection through Formosa, at which time the ancestors of the peculiar forms of deer entered the
  country. It may indeed be objected that our knowledge of these islands is far too imperfect to
  arrive at any satisfactory conclusions as to their former history; but although many more species
  no doubt remain to be discovered, experience shows that the broad characters of a fauna are always
  determined by a series of collections made by different persons, at various localities, and at
  different times, even when more imperfect than those of the Philippine birds really are. The
  isolated position, and the volcanic structure of the group, would lead us to expect them to be
  somewhat less productive than the Moluccas, close to the rich and varied Papuan district,&mdash;or
  than Celebes, with its numerous indications of an extensive area and great antiquity; and taking
  into account the excessive poverty of its mammalian fauna, which is certain to be pretty well
  known, I am inclined to believe that no future discoveries will materially alter the character of
  Philippine ornithology, as determined from the materials already at our command.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Java.</i>&mdash;Following the same plan as we have adopted in first discussing the
  Philippine islands, and separating them from the body of the sub-region on account of special
  peculiarities, we must next take Java, as possessing marked individuality, and as being to some
  extent more isolated in its productions than the remaining great islands.</p>

  <p>Java is well supplied with indigenous mammalia, possessing as nearly as can be ascertained 55
  genera and 90 species. None of these genera are peculiar, and only about 5 of the species,&mdash;3
  quadrumana, a deer and a wild pig. So far then there is nothing remarkable in its fauna, but on
  comparing it with that of the other great islands, viz., Borneo and Sumatra, and the Malay
  peninsula, we find an unmistakable deficiency of characteristic forms, the same in kind as that we
  have just commented on in the case of the Philippines, though much less in degree. First, taking
  genera which are found in all three of the above-named <span class="pagenum"
  id="page350">{350}</span>localities and which must therefore be held to be typical Malayan groups,
  the following are absent from Java: <i>Viverra</i>, <i>Gymnopus</i>, <i>Lutra</i>,
  <i>Helarctos</i>, <i>Tapirus</i>, <i>Elephas</i>, and <i>Gymnura</i>; while of those <i>known</i>
  to occur in two, and which, owing to our imperfect knowledge, may very probably one day be
  discovered in the third, the following are equally wanting: <i>Simia</i>, <i>Siamanga</i>,
  <i>Hemigalea</i>, <i>Paguma</i>, <i>Rhinosciurus</i>, and <i>Rhizomys</i>. It may be said this is
  only negative evidence, but in the case of Java it is much more, because this island is not only
  the best known of any in the archipelago, but there is perhaps no portion of British India of
  equal extent so well known. It is one of the oldest of the Dutch possessions and the seat of their
  colonial government; good roads traverse it in every direction, and experienced naturalists have
  been resident in various parts of it for years together, and have visited every mountain and every
  forest, aided by bands of diligent native collectors. We should be almost as likely to find new
  species of mammalia in Central Europe as in Java; and therefore the absence of such animals as the
  Malay bear, the elephant, tapir, gymnura, and even less conspicuous forms, must be accepted as a
  positive fact.</p>

  <p>In the other islands there are still vast tracts of forest in the hands of natives and utterly
  unexplored, and any similar absence in their case will prove little; yet on making the same
  comparison in the case of Borneo, the most peculiar and the least known of the other portions of
  the sub-region, we find only 2 genera absent which are found in the three other divisions, and
  only 3 which are found in two others. A fact to be noted also is, that the only genus found in
  Java but not in other parts of the sub-region (<i>Helictis</i>) occurs again in North India; and
  that some Javan <i>species</i>, as <i>Rhinoceros javanicus</i>, and <i>Lepus kurgosa</i> occur
  again in the Indo-Chinese sub-region, but not in the Malayan.</p>

  <p>Among the birds we meet with facts of a similar import; and though the absence of certain types
  from Java is not quite so certain as among the mammalia, this is more than balanced by the
  increased number of such deficiencies, so that if a few <span class="pagenum"
  id="page351">{351}</span>should be proved to be erroneous, the main result will remain
  unaltered.</p>

  <p>Java possesses about 270 species of land birds, of which about 40 are peculiar to it. There
  are, however, very few peculiar genera, <i>Laniellus</i>, a beautiful spotted shrike, being the
  most distinct, while <i>Cochoa</i> and <i>Psaltria</i> are perhaps not different from their Indian
  allies. The island has however a marked individuality in two ways&mdash;in the absence of
  characteristic Malayan types, and in the presence of a number of forms not yet found in any of the
  other Malay islands, but having their nearest allies in various parts of the Indo-Chinese
  sub-region. The following 16 genera are all found in Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are absent
  from Java: <i>Setornis</i>, <i>Temnurus</i>, <i>Dendrocitta</i>, <i>Corydon</i>,
  <i>Calyptomena</i>, <i>Venilia</i>, <i>Reinwardtipicus</i>, <i>Caloramphus</i>, <i>Rhinortha</i>,
  <i>Nyctiornis</i>, <i>Cranorhinus</i>, <i>Psittinus</i>, <i>Polyplectron</i>, <i>Argusianus</i>,
  <i>Euplocamus</i>, and <i>Rollulus</i>. The following 9 are known from <i>two</i> of the above
  localities, and will very probably be found in the third, but are absent from, and not likely to
  occur in, Java: <i>Trichixos</i>, <i>Eupetes</i>, <i>Melanochlora</i>, <i>Chaptia</i>,
  <i>Pityriasis</i>, <i>Lyncornis</i>, <i>Carpococcyx</i>, <i>Poliococcyx</i>, and <i>Rhinoplax</i>.
  We have thus 25 typically Malayan genera which are not known to occur in Java.</p>

  <p>The following genera, on the other hand, do not occur in any of the Malayan sub-divisions
  except Java, and they all occur again, or under closely allied forms, in the Indo-Chinese
  sub-region; <i>Brachypteryx</i> (allied species in Himalayas); <i>Zoothera</i> (allied species in
  Aracan); <i>Notodela</i> (allied species in Pegu); <i>Pnoëpyga</i> (allied species in Himalayas);
  <i>Allotrius</i> (allied species in the Himalayas); <i>Cochoa</i> (allied species in the
  Himalayas); <i>Crypsirhina</i> (allied species in Burmah); <i>Estrilda</i> (allied species in
  India); <i>Psaltria</i> (allied genus&mdash;<i>Ægithaliscus</i>&mdash;in Himalayas); <i>Pavo
  muticus</i> and <i>Harpactes oreskios</i> (same species in Siam and Burmah); <i>Cecropis
  striolata</i> (same species in Java and Formosa, and allied species in India).</p>

  <p>Here we have 12 instances of very remarkable distribution, and considering that there are
  nearly as many birds known from Sumatra and Borneo as from Java, and considerably more from <span
  class="pagenum" id="page352">{352}</span>the Malay peninsula, it is not likely that many of these
  well marked forms will be discovered in these countries.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There are also a considerable number of species of birds common to Malacca,
  Sumatra, and Borneo, but represented in Java by distinct though closely allied species. Such
  are,&mdash;</p>

  <p>Now if we look at our map of the region, and consider the position of Java with regard to
  Borneo, Sumatra, and the Indo-Chinese peninsula, the facts just pointed out appear most anomalous
  and perplexing. First, we have Java and Sumatra forming one continuous line of volcanoes,
  separated by a very narrow strait, and with all the appearance of having formed one continuous
  land; yet their productions differ considerably, and those of Sumatra show the closest resemblance
  to those of Borneo, an island ten times further off than Java and differing widely in the absence
  of volcanoes or any continuous range of lofty mountains. Then again, not only does Java differ
  from these two, but it agrees with a country beyond them both&mdash;a country from which they seem
  to have a much better chance to have been supplied by immigration than Java has, and to have
  (almost necessarily) participated, even more largely, in the benefits of any means of transmission
  capable of reaching the latter island. Yet more; whatever changes have occurred to bring about the
  anomalous state of things that exists must have been, zoologically and geologically, recent; for
  the strange cross-affinities between Java and the Indo-Chinese continent (in which Sumatra and
  Borneo have not participated), as well as that between Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo (in which Java
  has not participated) are exhibited, in many cases by community of <i>species</i>, in others by
  the presence of very closely allied forms of the same <i>genera</i>, of mammalia and birds. Now we
  know that <span class="pagenum" id="page353">{353}</span>these higher animals become replaced by
  allied species much more rapidly than the mollusca; and it is also pretty certain that the
  modification by which this replacement is effected takes place more rapidly when the two sets of
  individuals are isolated from each other, and especially when they are restricted to islands,
  where they are necessarily subject to distinct and pretty constant conditions, both physical and
  organic. It becomes therefore almost a certainty, that Siam and Java on the one hand, and Sumatra,
  Borneo, and Malacca on the other must have been brought into some close connexion, not earlier
  than the newer Pliocene period; but while the one set of countries were having their meeting, the
  other must have been by some means got out of the way. Before attempting to indicate the mode by
  which this might have been effected in accordance with what we know of the physical geography,
  geology, and vegetation of the several islands, it will be as well to complete our sketch of their
  zoological relations to each other, so as ascertain with some precision, what are the facts of
  distribution which we have to explain.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo.</i>&mdash;After having set apart the Philippine Islands and
  Java, we have remaining two great islands and a peninsula, which, though separated by considerable
  arms of the sea, possess a fauna of wonderful uniformity having all the typical Malayan features
  in their full development. Their unity is indeed so complete, that we can find hardly any groups
  of sufficient importance by which to differentiate them from each other; and we feel no confidence
  that future discoveries may not take away what speciality they possess. One after another, species
  or genera once peculiar to Borneo or Sumatra have been found elsewhere; and this has gone to such
  an extent in birds, that hardly a peculiar genus and very few peculiar species are left in either
  island. Borneo however is undoubtedly the most peculiar. It possesses three genera of Mammalia not
  found elsewhere; <i>Cynogale</i>, a curious carnivore allied to the otters; with <i>Dendrogale</i>
  and <i>Ptilocerus</i>, small insectivora allied to <i>Tupaia</i>. It has <i>Simia</i>, the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page354">{354}</span>Orang-utan, and <i>Paguma</i>, one of the Viverridæ, in
  common with Sumatra; as well as <i>Rhinosciurus</i>, a peculiar form of squirrel, and
  <i>Hemigalea</i>, one of the Viverridæ, in common with Malacca. Sumatra has only one genus not
  found in any other Malayan district&mdash;<i>Nemorhedus</i>, a form of antelope which occurs again
  in North India. It also has <i>Siamanga</i> in common with Malacca, <i>Mydaus</i> with Java, and
  <i>Rhizomys</i> with India. The Malay Peninsula seems to have no peculiar forms of Mammalia,
  though it is rich in all the characteristic Malay types.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The bats of the various islands have been very unequally collected, 36 species
  being recorded from Java, 23 from Sumatra, but only 16 each from Borneo and Malacca. Leaving these
  out of consideration, and taking into account the terrestrial mammals only, we find that Java is
  the poorest in species, while Borneo, Sumatra, and Malacca are tolerably equal; the numbers being
  55, 62, 66, and 65 respectively. Of these we find that the species confined to each island or
  district are (in the same order) 6, 16, 5, and 6. It thus appears that Borneo is, in its mammalia,
  the most isolated and peculiar; next comes Sumatra, and then Malacca and Java, as shown by the
  following table.</p>

  <p>This result differs from that which we have arrived at by the more detailed consideration of
  the fauna of Java; and it serves to show that the estimate of a country by the number of its
  peculiar genera and species alone, may not always represent its true zoological importance or its
  most marked features. Java, as we have seen, is differentiated from the other three districts by
  the absence of numerous types common to them all, and by its independent continental relations.
  Borneo is also well distinguished by its peculiar genera and specific types, yet it is at the same
  time more closely related to Sumatra and Malacca than is Java. The two islands have evidently had
  a very different history, which a detailed knowledge of their geology <span class="pagenum"
  id="page355">{355}</span>would alone enable us to trace. Should we ever arrive at a fair knowledge
  of the physical changes that have resulted in the present condition, we shall almost certainly
  find that many of the differences and anomalies of their existing fauna and flora will be
  accounted for.</p>

  <p>In Birds we hardly find anything to differentiate Borneo and Sumatra in any clear manner.
  <i>Pityriasis</i> and <i>Carpococcyx</i>, once thought peculiar to the former, are now found also
  in the latter; and we have not a single genus left to characterize Borneo except <i>Schwaneria</i>
  a peculiar fly-catcher, and <i>Indicator</i>, an African and Indian group not known to occur
  elsewhere in the Malay sub-region. Sumatra as yet alone possesses <i>Psilopogon</i>, a remarkable
  form of barbet, but we may well expect that it will be soon found in the interior of Borneo or
  Malacca; it also has <i>Berenicornis</i>, an African form of hornbill. The Malay Peninsula appears
  to have no genus peculiar to it, but it possesses some Chinese and Indian forms which do not pass
  into the islands. As to the species, our knowledge of them is at present very imperfect. The Malay
  Peninsula is perhaps the best known, but it is probable that both Sumatra and Borneo are quite as
  rich in species. With the exception of the genera noted above, and two or three others as yet
  found in two islands only, the three districts we are now considering may be said to have an
  almost identical bird-fauna, consisting largely of the same species and almost wholly of these
  together with closely allied species of the same genera. There are no well-marked groups which
  especially characterise one of these islands rather than the other, so that even the amount of
  speciality which Borneo undoubtedly exhibits as regards mammalia, is only faintly shown by its
  birds. The Pittidæ may perhaps be named as the most characteristic Bornean group, that island
  possessing six species, three of which are peculiar to it and are among the most beautiful birds
  of an unusually beautiful family. Yet Sumatra possesses two peculiar, and hardly less remarkable
  species.</p>

  <p>In other classes of vertebrates, in insects, and in land-shells, our knowledge is far too
  imperfect to allow of our making any useful comparison between the faunas.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page356">{356}</span></div>

  <p><i>Banca.</i>&mdash;We must, however note the fact of peculiar species occurring in Banca, a
  small island close to Sumatra, and thus offering another problem in distribution. A squirrel
  (<i>Sciurus bangkanus</i>) is allied to three species found in Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo
  respectively, but quite as distinct from them all as they are from each other. More curious are
  the two species of <i>Pitta</i> peculiar to Banca; one, <i>Pitta megarhynchus</i>, is allied to
  the <i>P. brachyurus</i>, which inhabits the whole sub-region and extends to Siam and China, but
  differs from it in its very large bill and differently coloured head; the other, <i>P.
  bangkanus</i>, is allied to <i>P. cucullatus</i>, which extends from Nepal to Malacca, and to
  <i>P. sordidus</i>, which inhabits both Borneo and Sumatra as well as the Philippines.</p>

  <p>We have here, on a small scale, a somewhat similar problem to that of Java, and as this is
  comparatively easy of solution we will consider it first. Although, on the map, Banca is so very
  close to Sumatra, the observer on the spot at once sees that the proximity has been recently
  brought about. The whole south-east coast of Sumatra is a great alluvial plain, hardly yet raised
  above the sea level, and half flooded in the wet season. It is plainly a recent formation, caused
  by the washing down into a shallow sea of the <i>débris</i> from the grand range of volcanic
  mountains 150 miles distant. Banca, on the other hand is, though low, a rugged and hilly island,
  formed almost wholly of ancient rocks of apparently volcanic origin, and closely resembling parts
  of the Malay Peninsula and the intervening chain of small islands. There is every appearance that
  Banca once formed the extremity of the Peninsula, at which time it would probably have been
  separated from Sumatra by 50 or 100 miles of sea. Its productions should, therefore, most resemble
  those of Singapore and Malacca, and the few peculiar species it possesses will be due to their
  isolation in a small tract of country, surrounded by a limited number of animal and vegetable
  forms, and subject to the influence of a peculiar soil and climate. The parent species existing in
  such large tracts as Borneo or Sumatra, subjected to more varied conditions of soil, climate,
  vegetation, food, and enemies, would preserve, almost or quite <span class="pagenum"
  id="page357">{357}</span>unchanged, the characteristics which had been developed under nearly
  identical conditions when the great island formed part of the continent. Geology teaches us that
  similar changes in the forms of the higher vertebrates have taken place during the Post-Tertiary
  epoch; and there are other reasons for believing that, under such conditions of isolation as in
  Banca, the change may have required but a very moderate period, even reckoned in years. We will
  now return to the more difficult problem presented by the peculiar continental relations of Java,
  as already detailed.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Probable Recent Geographical Changes in the Indo-Malay Islands.</i>&mdash;Although Borneo is
  by far the largest of the Indo-Malay islands, yet its physical conformation is such that, were a
  depression to occur of one or two thousand feet, it would be reduced to a smaller continuous area
  than either Sumatra or Java. Except in its northern portion it possesses no lofty mountains, while
  alluvial valleys of great extent penetrate far into its interior. A very moderate depression, of
  perhaps 500 feet, would convert it into an island shaped something like Celebes; and its mountains
  are of so small an average elevation, and consist so much of isolated hills and detached ranges,
  that a depression of 2,000 feet would almost certainly break it up into a group of small islands,
  with a somewhat larger one to the north. Sumatra (and to a less extent Java) consists of an almost
  continuous range of lofty mountains, connected by plateaus from 3,000 to 4,000 feet high; so that
  although a depression of 2,000 feet would greatly diminish their size, it would probably leave the
  former a single island, while the latter would be separated into two principal islands of still
  considerable extent. The enormous amount of volcanic action in these two islands, and the great
  number of conical mountains which must have been slowly raised, chiefly by ejected matter, to the
  height of 10,000 and 12,000 feet, and whose shape indicates that they have been formed above
  water, renders it almost certain that for long periods they have not undergone submersion to any
  considerable extent. In Borneo, however, we have no such evidences. No volcano, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page358">{358}</span>active or extinct, is known in its entire area; while
  extensive beds of coal of tertiary age, in every part of it, prove that it has been subject to
  repeated submersions, at no distant date geologically. An indication, if not a proof, of still
  more recent submersion is to be found in the great alluvial valleys which on the south and
  south-west extend fully 200 miles inland, while they are to a less degree a characteristic feature
  all round the island. These swampy plains have been formed by the combined action of rivers and
  tides; and they point clearly to an immediately preceding state of things, when that which is even
  now barely raised above the ocean, was more or less sunk below it.</p>

  <p>These various indications enable us to claim, as an admissible and even probable supposition,
  that at some epoch during the Pliocene period of geology, Borneo, as we now know it, did not
  exist; but was represented by a mountainous island at its present northern extremity, with perhaps
  a few smaller islets to the south. We thus have a clear opening from Java to the Siamese
  Peninsula; and as the whole of that sea is less than 100 fathoms deep, there is no difficulty in
  supposing an elevation of land connecting the two together, quite independent of Borneo on the one
  hand and Sumatra on the other. This union did not probably last long; but it was sufficient to
  allow of the introduction into Java of the <i>Rhinoceros javanicus</i>, and that group of
  Indo-Chinese and Himalayan species of mammalia and birds which it alone possesses. When this ridge
  had disappeared by subsidence, the next elevation occurred a little more to the east, and produced
  the union of many islets which, aided by sub-aerial denudation, formed the present island of
  Borneo. It is probable that this elevation was sufficiently extensive to unite Borneo for a time
  with the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, thus helping to produce that close resemblance of genera and
  even of species, which these countries exhibit, and obliterating much of their former speciality,
  of which, however, we have still some traces in the long-nosed monkey and <i>Ptilocerus</i> of
  Borneo, and the considerable number of genera both of mammalia and birds confined to two only out
  of the three divisions of typical Malaya. The subsidence which again divided these <span
  class="pagenum" id="page359">{359}</span>countries by arms of the sea rather wider than at
  present, might have left Banca isolated, as already referred to, with its proportion of the common
  fauna to be, in a few instances, subsequently modified.</p>

  <p>Thus we are enabled to understand how the special relations of the <i>species</i> of these
  islands to each other may have been brought about. To account for their more deep-seated and
  general zoological features, we must go farther back.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Probable Origin of the Malayan Fauna.</i>&mdash;The typical Malayan fauna is essentially an
  equatorial one, and must have been elaborated in an extensive equatorial area. This ancient land
  almost certainly extended northward over the shallow sea as far as the island of Palawan, the
  Paracels shoals and even Hainan. To the east, it may at one time have included the Philippines and
  Celebes, but not the Moluccas. To the south it was limited by the deep sea beyond Java. It
  included all Sumatra and the Nicobar islands, and there is every reason to believe that it
  stretched out also to the west so as to include the central peak of Ceylon, the Maldive isles, and
  the Cocos islands west of Sumatra. We should then have an area as extensive as South America to
  15° south latitude, and well calculated to develop that luxuriant fauna and flora which has since
  spread to the Himalayas. The submergence of the western half of this area (leaving only a fragment
  in Ceylon) would greatly diminish the number of animals and perhaps extinguish some peculiar
  types; but the remaining portion would still form a compact and extensive district, twice as large
  as the peninsula of India, over the whole of which a uniform Malayan fauna would prevail. The
  first important change would be the separation of Celebes; and this was probably effected by a
  great subsidence, forming the deep strait that now divides that island from Borneo. During the
  process Celebes itself was no doubt greatly submerged, leaving only a few islands in which were
  preserved that remnant of the ancient Malayan fauna that now constitutes one of its most striking
  and anomalous features. The Philippine area would next be separated, and perhaps be almost wholly
  submerged; or <span class="pagenum" id="page360">{360}</span>broken up into many small volcanic
  islets in which a limited number of Malayan types alone survived. Such a condition of things will
  account for the very small variety of mammalia compared with the tolerably numerous genera of
  birds, that now characterise its fauna; while both here and in Celebes we find some of the old
  Malayan types preserved, which, in the extended area of the Sunda Isles have been replaced by more
  dominant forms.</p>

  <p>The next important change would be the separation of Java; and here also no doubt a
  considerable submergence occurred, rendering the island an unsuitable habitation for the various
  Malay types whose absence forms one of its conspicuous features. It has since remained permanently
  separated from the other islands, and has no doubt developed some peculiar species, while it may
  have preserved some ancient forms which in the larger area have become changed. From the fact that
  a number of its species are confined either to the western or the eastern half of the island, it
  is probable that it long continued as two islands, which have become united at a comparatively
  recent period. It has also been subjected to the immigration of Indo-Chinese forms, as already
  referred to in the earlier part of this sketch.</p>

  <p>We have thus shown how the main zoological features of the several sub-divisions of the Malayan
  sub-region may be accounted for, by means of a series of suppositions as to past changes which,
  though for the most part purely hypothetical, are always in accordance with what we know both of
  the physical geography and the zoology of the districts in question and those which surround them.
  It may also be remarked, that we know, with a degree of certainty which may be called absolute,
  that alternate elevation and subsidence is the normal state of things all over the globe; that it
  was the rule in the earliest geological epochs, and that it has continued down to the historical
  era. We know too, that the <i>amount</i> of elevation and subsidence that can be proved to have
  occurred again and again in the same area, is often much greater than is required for the changes
  here speculated on,&mdash;while the <i>time</i> required for such changes is certainly less than
  that necessitated by the changes <span class="pagenum" id="page361">{361}</span>of specific and
  generic forms which have coincided with, and been to a large extent dependent on them. We have,
  therefore, true causes at work, and our only suppositions have been as to how those causes could
  have brought about the results which we see; and however complex and unlikely some of the supposed
  changes may seem to the reader, the geologist who has made a study of such changes, as recorded in
  the crust of the earth, will not only admit them to be probable, but will be inclined to believe
  that they have really been far more complex and more unexpected than any supposition we can make
  about them.</p>

  <p>There is one other external relation of the Malayan fauna about which it may be necessary to
  say a few words. I have supposed the greatest westward extension of the Malayan area to be
  indicated by the Maldive islands, but some naturalists would extend it to include Madagascar in
  order to account for the range of the Lemuridæ. Such an extension would, however, render it
  difficult to explain the very small amount of correspondence with a pervading diversity, between
  the Malayan and Malagasy faunas. It seems more reasonable to suppose an approximation of the two
  areas, without actual union having ever occurred. This approximation would have allowed the
  interchange of certain genera of birds, which are common to the Oriental Region and the Mascarene
  islands, but it would have been too recent to account for the diffusion of the lemurs, which
  belong to distinct genera and even distinct families. This probably dates back to a much earlier
  period, when the lemurine type had a wide range over the northern hemisphere. Subjected to the
  competition of higher forms, these imperfectly developed groups have mostly died out, except a few
  isolated examples, chiefly found in islands, and a few groups in Africa.</p>

  <p>In our discussion of the origin of the Ethiopian fauna, we have supposed that a close
  connection once existed between Madagascar and Ceylon. This was during a very early tertiary
  epoch; and if, long after it had ceased and the fauna of Ceylon and South India had assumed
  somewhat more of their present character, we suppose the approximation or union of Ceylon <span
  class="pagenum" id="page362">{362}</span>and Malaya to have taken place, we shall perhaps be able
  to account for most of the special affinities they present, with the least amount of simultaneous
  elevation of the ocean bed; which it must always be remembered, requires a corresponding
  depression elsewhere to balance it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Concluding Remarks on the Oriental Region.</i>&mdash;We have already so fully
  discussed the internal and external relations of the several sub-regions, that little more need be
  said. The rich and varied fauna which inhabited Europe at the dawn of the tertiary
  period,&mdash;as shown by the abundant remains of mammalia wherever suitable deposits of Eocene
  age have been discovered,&mdash;proves, that an extensive Palæarctic continent then existed; and
  the character of the flora and fauna of the Eocene deposits is so completely tropical, that we may
  be sure there was then no barrier of climate between it and the Oriental region. At that early
  period the northern plains of Asia were probably under water, while the great Thibetan plateau and
  the Himalayan range, had not risen to more than a moderate height, and would have supported a
  luxuriant sub-tropical flora and fauna. The Upper Miocene deposits of northern and central India,
  and Burmah, agree in their mammalian remains with those of central and southern Europe, while
  closely allied forms of elephant, hyæna, tapir, rhinoceros, and <i>Chalicotherium</i> have
  occurred in North China; leading us to conclude that one great fauna then extended over much of
  the Oriental and Palæarctic regions. Perim island at the mouth of the Red Sea, where similar
  remains are found, probably shows the southern boundary of this part of the old Palæarctic region
  in the Miocene period. Towards the equator there would, of course, be some peculiar groups; but we
  can hardly doubt, that, in that wonderful time when even the lands that stretched out furthest
  towards the pole, supported a luxuriant forest vegetation, substantially one fauna ranged over the
  whole of the great eastern continent of the northern hemisphere. During the Pliocene period,
  however, a progressive change went on which resulted in the complete differentiation of the
  Oriental and Palæarctic faunas. The <span class="pagenum" id="page363">{363}</span>causes of this
  change were of two kinds. There was a great geographical and physical revolution effected by the
  elevation of the Himalayas and the Thibetan plateau, and, probably at the same time, the northward
  extension of the great Siberian plains. This alone would produce an enormous change of climate in
  all the extra-tropical part of Asia, and inevitably lead to a segregation of the old fauna into
  tropical and temperate, and a modification of the latter so as to enable it to support a climate
  far more severe than it had previously known. But it is almost certain that, concurrently with
  this, there was a change going on of a cosmical nature, leading to an alteration of the climate of
  the northern hemisphere from equable to extreme, and culminating in that period of excessive cold
  which drove the last remnants of the old sub-tropical fauna beyond the limits of the Palæarctic
  region. From that time, the Oriental and the Ethiopian regions alone contained the descendants of
  many of the most remarkable types which had previously flourished over all Europe and Asia; but
  the early history of these two regions, and the peculiar equatorial types developed in each,
  sufficiently separate them, as we have already shown. The Malayan sub-region is that in which
  characteristic Oriental types are now best developed, and where the fundamental contrast of the
  Oriental, as compared with the Ethiopian and Palæarctic regions, is most distinctly visible.</p>

  AUSTRALIAN REGION.</span></span></p>

  <p>The Australian is the great insular region of the earth. As a whole it is one of the best
  marked, and has even been considered to be equal in zoological value to all the rest of the globe;
  but its separate portions are very heterogeneous, and their limits sometimes ill-defined. Its
  central and most important masses consist of Australia and New Guinea, in which the main features
  of the region are fully developed. To the north-west it extends to Celebes, in which a large
  proportion of the Australian characters have disappeared, while Oriental types are mingled with
  them to such an extent that it is rather difficult to determine where to locate it. To the
  south-east it includes New Zealand, which is in some respects so peculiar, that it has even been
  proposed to constitute it a distinct region. On the east it embraces the whole of Oceania to the
  Marquesas and Sandwich Islands, whose very scanty and often peculiar fauna, must be affiliated to
  the general Australian type.</p>

  <p>Australia is the largest tract of land in the region, being several times more extensive than
  all the other islands combined, and it is here that the greatest variety of peculiar types have
  been developed. This island-continent, being situated in the track of the southern desert zone,
  and having no central mountains to condense the vapours from the surrounding ocean, has a large
  portion of its interior so parched up and barren as to be almost destitute of animal life. The
  most extensive tract of fertile and well-watered country is on the east and south-east, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page388">{388}</span>where a fine range of mountains reaches, in the Colony of
  Victoria, the limits of perpetual snow. The west coast also possesses mountains of moderate
  height, but the climate is very dry and hot. The northern portion is entirely tropical, yet it
  nowhere presents the luxuriance of vegetation characteristic of the great island of New Guinea
  immediately to the north of it. Taken as a whole, Australia is characterized by an arid climate
  and a deficiency of water; conditions which have probably long prevailed, and under which its very
  peculiar fauna and flora have been developed. This fact will account for some of the marked
  differences between it and the adjacent sub-regions of New Guinea and the Moluccas, where the
  climate is moist, and the vegetation luxuriant; and these divergent features must never be lost
  sight of, in comparing the different portions of the Australian region. In Tasmania alone, which
  is however, essentially a detached portion of Australia, a more uniform and moister climate
  prevails; but it is too small a tract of land, and has been too recently severed from its parent
  mass to have developed a special fauna.</p>

  <p>The Austro-Malay sub-region (of which New Guinea is the central and typical mass) is strikingly
  contrasted with Australia, being subjected to purely equatorial conditions,&mdash;a high, but
  uniform temperature, excessive moisture, and a luxuriant forest vegetation, exactly similar in
  general features to that which clothes the Indo-Malay Islands, and the other portions of the great
  equatorial forest zone. Such a climate and vegetation, being the necessary result of its
  geographical position, must have existed from remote geological epochs with but little change, and
  must therefore have profoundly affected all the forms of life which have been developed under
  their influence. Around New Guinea as a centre are grouped a number of important islands, more or
  less closely agreeing with it in physical features, climate, vegetation, and forms of life. In
  most immediate connection we place the Aru Islands, Mysol and Waigiou, with Jobie and the other
  Islands in Geelvinck Bay, all of which are connected with it by shallow seas; they possess one of
  its most characteristic groups, the Birds of Paradise, and have no doubt only recently (in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page389">{389}</span>a geological sense) been separated from it. In the next
  rank come the large islands of the Moluccas on the west, and the range terminating in the Solomon
  Islands on the east, both of which groups possess a clearly Papuan fauna, although deficient in
  many of the most remarkable Papuan types.</p>

  <p>All these islands agree closely with New Guinea itself in being very mountainous, and covered
  with a luxuriant forest vegetation; but to the south-west we find a set of islands extending from
  Timor to Lombock, which agree more nearly with Australia, both in climate and vegetation; being
  arid and abounding in eucalypti, acacias, and thickets of thorny shrubs. These, like the Moluccas,
  are surrounded by deep sea, and it is doubtful whether they have either of them been actually
  connected with New Guinea or Australia in recent geological times; but the general features of
  their zoology oblige us to unite all these islands with New Guinea as forming the Austro-Malay
  sub-division of the Australian region. Still further west however, we have the large island of
  Celebes, whose position is very difficult to determine. It is mountainous, but has also extensive
  plains and low lands. Its climate is somewhat arid in the south, where the woods are often
  scattered and thorny, while in the north it is moister, and the forests are luxuriant. It is
  surrounded by deep seas, but also by coralline and volcanic islets, indicating former elevations
  and subsidences. Its fauna presents the most puzzling relations, showing affinities to Java, to
  the Philippines, to the Moluccas, to New Guinea, to continental India, and even to Africa; so that
  it is almost impossible to decide whether to place it in the Oriental or the Australian region. On
  the whole the preponderance of its relations appears to be with the latter, though it is
  undoubtedly very anomalous, and may, with almost as much propriety, be classed with the former.
  This will be better understood when we come to discuss its zoological peculiarities.</p>

  <p>The next sub-region consists of the extensive series of islands scattered over the Pacific, the
  principal groups being the Sandwich Islands, the Marquesas and Society Islands, the Navigators',
  Friendly, and Fiji Islands. New Caledonia and the New <span class="pagenum"
  id="page390">{390}</span>Hebrides have rather an uncertain position, and it is difficult to decide
  whether to class them with the Austro-Malay Islands, the Pacific Islands, or Australia. The
  islands of the west Pacific, north of the equator, also probably come into this region, although
  the Ladrone Islands may belong to the Philippines; but as the fauna of all these small islets is
  very scanty, and very little known, they are not at present of much importance.</p>

  <p>There remains the islands of New Zealand, with the surrounding small islands, as far as the
  Auckland, Chatham, and Norfolk Islands. These are situated in the south temperate forest-zone.
  They are mountainous, and have a moist, equable, and temperate climate. They are true oceanic
  islands, and the total absence of mammalia intimates that they have not been connected with
  Australia or any other continent in recent geological times. The general character of their
  zoology, no less than their botany, affiliates them however, to Australia as portions of the same
  zoological region.</p>

  <p><i>General Zoological Characteristics of the Australian Region.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of
  giving an idea of the very peculiar and striking features which characterise the Australian
  region, it will be as well at first to confine ourselves to the great central land masses of
  Australia and New Guinea, where those features are manifested in their greatest force and purity,
  leaving the various peculiarities and anomalies of the outlying islands to be dealt with
  subsequently.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The Australian region is broadly distinguished from all the rest of the
  globe by the entire absence of all the orders of non-aquatic mammalia that abound in the Old
  World, except two&mdash;the winged bats (Chiroptera), and the equally cosmopolite rodents
  (Rodentia). Of these latter however, only one family is represented&mdash;the
  Muridæ&mdash;(comprising the rats and mice), and the Australian representatives of these are all
  of small or moderate size&mdash;a suggestive fact in appreciating the true character of the
  Australian fauna. In place of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, and Ungulates, which abound in endless
  variety in all the other regions under equally favourable conditions, Australia possesses two new
  orders (or perhaps <span class="pagenum" id="page391">{391}</span>sub-classes)&mdash;Marsupialia
  and Monotremata, found nowhere else on the globe except a single family of the former in America.
  The Marsupials are wonderfully developed in Australia, where they exist in the most diversified
  forms, adapted to different modes of life. Some are carnivorous, some herbivorous; some arboreal,
  others terrestrial. There are insect-eaters, root-gnawers, fruit-eaters, honey-eaters, leaf or
  grass-feeders. Some resemble wolves, others marmots, weasels, squirrels, flying squirrels, dormice
  or jerboas. They are classed in six distinct families, comprising about thirty genera, and
  subserve most of the purposes in the economy of nature, fulfilled in other parts of the world by
  very different groups; yet they all possess common peculiarities of structure and habits which
  show that they are members of one stock, and have no real affinity with the Old-World forms which
  they often outwardly resemble.</p>

  <p>The other order, Monotremata, is only represented by two rare and very remarkable forms,
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> and <i>Echidna</i>, probably the descendants of some of those earlier
  developments of mammalian life which in every other part of the globe have long been extinct.</p>

  <p>The bats of Australia all belong to Old-World genera and possess no features of special
  interest, a result of the wandering habits of these aerial mammals. The Rodents are more
  interesting. They are all more or less modified forms of mice or rats. Some belong to the widely
  distributed genus <i>Mus</i>, others to four allied genera, which may be all modifications of some
  common Old-World form. They spread all over Australia, and allied species occur in Celebes<span
  class="correction" title="added by Errata"> and the Papuan Islands</span>, so that although not
  yet known from <span class="correction" title="&quot;New Guinea&quot; deleted by Errata">the
  Moluccas</span>, there can be little doubt that some of them exist there.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The typical Australian region, as above defined, is almost as well
  characterized by its birds, as by its mammalia; but in this case the deficiencies are less
  conspicuous, while the peculiar and characteristic families are numerous and important. The most
  marked deficiency as regards wide-spread families, is the total absence of Fringillidæ (true
  finches), Picidæ (woodpeckers), Vulturidæ (vultures), and Phasianidæ (pheasants). <span
  class="pagenum" id="page392">{392}</span>and among prevalent Oriental groups, Pycnonotidæ
  (bulbuls), Phyllornithidæ (green bulbuls), and Megalæmidæ (barbets) are families whose absence is
  significant. Nine families are peculiar to the region, or only just pass its limits in the case of
  single species. These are Paridiseidæ (paradise-birds), Meliphagidæ (honey-suckers), Menuridæ
  (lyre-birds), Atrichidæ (scrub-birds), Cacatuidæ (cockatoos), Platycercidæ (broad-tailed and
  grass-paroquets), Trichoglossidæ (brush-tongued paroquets), Megapodiidæ (mound-makers), and
  Casuariidæ (cassowaries). There are also eight very characteristic families, of which
  four,&mdash;Pachycephalidæ (thick-headed shrikes), Campephagidæ (caterpillar shrikes), Dicæidæ
  (flower-peckers), and Artamidæ (swallow-shrikes)&mdash;are feebly represented elsewhere, while the
  other four&mdash;Ploceidæ (weaver-finches), Alcædinidæ (kingfishers), Podargidæ (frog-mouths), and
  Columbidæ (pigeons)&mdash;although widely distributed, are here unusually abundant and varied, and
  (except in the case of the Ploceidæ) better represented in the Australian than in any other
  region. Of all these the Meliphagidæ (honeysuckers) are the most peculiarly and characteristically
  Australian. This family abounds in genera and species; it extends into every part of the region
  from Celebes and Lombock on the west, to the Sandwich Islands, Marquesas, and New Zealand on the
  east, while not a single species overpasses its limits, with the exception of one (<i>Ptilotis
  limbata</i>) which abounds in all the islands of the Timorese group, and has crossed the narrow
  strait from Lombock to Baly; but this can hardly be considered to impugn the otherwise striking
  fact of wide diffusion combined with strict limitation, which characterizes it. This family is the
  more important, because, like the Trichoglossidæ or brush-tongued paroquets, it seems to have been
  developed in co-ordination with that wealth of nectariferous flowering shrubs and trees which is
  one of the marked features of Australian vegetation. It probably originated in the extensive
  land-area of Australia itself, and thence spread into all the tributary islands, where it has
  become variously modified, yet always in such close adaptation to the other great features of the
  Australian fauna, that it seems unable to maintain itself when subject to the competition of the
  more <span class="pagenum" id="page393">{393}</span>varied forms of life in the Oriental region;
  to which, possessing great powers of flight, some species must occasionally have emigrated. Its
  presence or absence serves therefore to define and limit the Australian region with a precision
  hardly to be equalled in the case of any other region or any other family of birds.</p>

  <p>The Trichoglossidæ, as already intimated, are another of these peculiarly organized Australian
  families,&mdash;parrots with an extensile brush-tipped tongue, adapted to extract the nectar and
  pollen from flowers. These are also rigidly confined to this region, but they do not range so
  completely over the whole of it, being absent from New Zealand (where however they are represented
  by a closely allied form <i>Nestor</i>), and from the Sandwich Islands. The Paradiseidæ (birds of
  paradise and allies) are another remarkable family, confined to the Papuan group of Islands, and
  the tropical parts of Australia. The Megapodiidæ (or mound-builders) are another most remarkable
  and anomalous group of birds, no doubt specially adapted to Australian conditions of existence.
  Their peculiarity consists in their laying enormous eggs (at considerable intervals of time) and
  burying them either in the loose hot sand of the beach above high-water mark, or in enormous
  mounds of leaves, sticks, earth, and refuse of all kinds, gathered together by the birds, whose
  feet and claws are enlarged and strengthened for the work. The warmth of this slightly fermenting
  mass hatches the eggs; when the young birds work their way out, and thenceforth take care of
  themselves, as they are able to run quickly, and even to fly short distances, as soon as they are
  hatched. This may perhaps be an adaptation to the peculiar condition of so large a portion of
  Australia, in respect to prolonged droughts and scanty water-supply, entailing a periodical
  scarcity of all kinds of food. In such a country the confinement of the parents to one spot during
  the long period of incubation would often lead to starvation, and the consequent death of the
  offspring. But the same birds with free power to roam about, might readily maintain themselves.
  This peculiar constitution and habit, which enabled the Megapodii to maintain an existence under
  the unfavourable conditions of their <span class="pagenum" id="page394">{394}</span>original
  habitat gives them a great advantage in the luxuriant islands of the Moluccas, to which they have
  spread. There they abound to a remarkable extent, and their eggs furnish a luxurious repast to the
  natives. They have also reached many of the smallest islets, and have spread beyond the limits of
  the region to the Philippines, and North-Western Borneo, as well as to the remote Nicobar
  Islands.</p>

  <p>The Platycercidæ, or broad-tailed paroquets, are another wide-spread Australian group, of weak
  structure but gorgeously coloured, ranging from the Moluccas to New Zealand and the Society
  Islands, and very characteristic of the region, to which they are strictly confined. The Cockatoos
  have not quite so wide a range, being confined to the Austro-Malayan and Australian sub-regions,
  while one species extends into the Philippine Islands. The other two peculiar families are more
  restricted in their range, and will be noticed under the sub-regions to which they respectively
  belong.</p>

  <p>Of the characteristic families, the Pachycephalidæ, or thick-headed shrikes, are especially
  Australian, ranging over all the region, except New Zealand; while only a single species has
  spread into the Oriental, and one of doubtful affinity to the Ethiopian region. The Artamidæ, or
  swallow-shrikes, are also almost wholly confined to the region, one species only extending to
  India. They range to the Fiji Islands on the east, but only to Tasmania on the south. These two
  families must be considered as really peculiar to Australia. The Podargidæ, or
  frog-mouths&mdash;large, thick-billed goat-suckers&mdash;are strange birds very characteristic of
  the Australian region, although they have representatives in the Oriental and Neotropical regions.
  Campephagidæ (caterpillar-shrikes) also abound, but they are fairly represented both in India and
  Africa. The Ploceidæ, or weaver-birds, are the finches of Australia, and present a variety of
  interesting and beautiful forms.</p>

  <p>We now come to the kingfishers, a cosmopolitan family of birds, yet so largely developed in the
  Australian region as to deserve special notice. Two-thirds of all the genera are found here, and
  no less than 10 out of the 19 genera in the family are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page395">{395}</span>peculiar to the Australian region. Another of the universally distributed
  families which have their metropolis here, is that of the Columbidæ or pigeons. Three-fourths of
  the genera have representatives in the Australian region, while two-fifths of the whole are
  confined to it; and it possesses as many species of pigeons as any other two regions combined. It
  also possesses the most remarkable forms, as exemplified in the great crowned pigeons
  (<i>Goura</i>) and the hook-billed <i>Didunculus</i>, while the green fruit-pigeons
  (<i>Ptilopus</i>) are sometimes adorned with colours vying with those of the gayest parrots or
  chatterers. This enormous development of a family of birds so defenceless as the pigeons, whose
  rude nests expose their eggs and helpless young to continual danger, may perhaps be correlated, as
  I have suggested elsewhere (Ibis, 1865, p. 366), with the entire absence of monkeys, cats, lemurs,
  weasels, civets and other arboreal mammals, which prey on eggs and young birds. The very prevalent
  green colour of the upper part of their plumage, may be due to the need of concealment from their
  only enemies,&mdash;birds of prey; and this is rendered more probable by the fact that it is among
  the pigeons of the small islands of the Pacific (where hawks and their allies are exceedingly
  scarce) that we alone meet with species whose entire plumage is a rich and conspicuous yellow.
  Where the need of concealment is least, the brilliancy of colour has attained its maximum. We may
  therefore look upon the genus <i>Ptilopus</i>, with its fifty species whose typical coloration is
  green, with patches of bright blue, red, or yellow on the head and breast, as a special
  development suited to the tropical portion of the Australian region, to which it is almost wholly
  confined.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the sketch just given, that the ornithological features of the Australian
  region are almost as remarkable as those presented by its Mammalian fauna; and from the fuller
  development attained by the aërial class of birds, much more varied and interesting. None of the
  other regions of the earth can offer us so many families with special points of interest in
  structure, or habits, or general relations. The paradise-birds, the honeysuckers, the
  brush-tongued paroquets, the mound-builders, and the cassowaries&mdash;all strictly peculiar <span
  class="pagenum" id="page396">{396}</span>to the region&mdash;with such remarkable developments as
  we have indicated in the kingfishers and pigeons, place the Australian region in the first rank
  for the variety, singularity, and interest of its birds, and only second to South America as
  regards numbers and beauty.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;In Reptiles the peculiarity of the main Australian region is less
  marked, although the fauna is sufficiently distinct. There is no family of snakes confined to the
  region, but many peculiar genera of the families Pythonidæ and Elapidæ. About two-thirds of the
  Australian snakes belong to the latter family, and are poisonous; so that although the Crotalidæ
  and Viperidæ are absent, there are perhaps a larger proportion of poisonous to harmless snakes
  than in any other part of the world. According to Mr. Gerard Krefft the proportion varies
  considerably in the different colonies. In Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland the
  proportion is about two to one; in West Australia three to one; and in South Australia six to one.
  In Tasmania there are only 3 species and all are poisonous. The number of species, as in other
  parts of the world, seems to increase with temperature. The 3 in Tasmania have increased to 12 in
  Victoria, 15 in South Australia and the same in West Australia; 31 in New South Wales, and 42 in
  sub-tropical Queensland.</p>

  <p>The lizards of Australia have lately been catalogued by Dr. Günther in the concluding part of
  the "Voyage of the Erebus and Terror," issued in 1875. They belong to 8 families, 3 of which are
  peculiar; 57 genera of which 36 are peculiar; and about 140 species, all but 2 or 3 of which are
  peculiar. The scinks and geckoes form the great bulk of the Australian lizards, with a few
  Agamidæ, Gymnopthalmidæ, and Varanidæ. The three peculiar families are the Pygopodidæ, Aprasiidæ
  and Lialidæ; comprising only 4 genera and 7 species. The above all belong to Australia proper.
  Those of the other sub-regions are few in number and will be noticed under their respective
  localities. They will perhaps bring up the number of genera to 70. West and South Australia seem
  to offer much peculiarity in their lizards; these districts possessing 12 peculiar genera, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page397">{397}</span>while a much smaller number are confined to the East and
  South-East, or to the North.</p>

  <p>Among the fresh-water turtles of the family Chelydidæ there are three peculiar
  genera&mdash;<i>Chelodina</i>, <i>Chelemys</i>, and <i>Elseya</i>, all from Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;No tailed amphibians are known from the whole region, but no less than
  eleven of the families of tail-less Batrachians (toads and frogs) are known to inhabit some part
  or other of it. A peculiar family (Xenorhinidæ), consisting of a single species, is found in New
  Guinea; the true toads (Bufonidæ) are only represented by a single species of a peculiar genus in
  Australia, and by a <i>Bufo</i> in Celebes. Nine of the families are represented in Australia
  itself, and the following genera are peculiar to it:&mdash;<i>Pseudophryne</i> (Phryniscidæ),
  <i>Pachybatrachus</i>, and <i>Chelydobatrachus</i> (Engystomydæ); <i>Helioporus</i> (Alytidæ);
  <i>Pelodyras</i> and <i>Chirodyras</i> (Pelodryadæ); <i>Notaden</i> (Bufonidæ).</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fish.</i>&mdash;There is only one peculiar family of fresh-water fishes in this
  region&mdash;the Gadopsidæ&mdash;represented by a single genus and species. The other species of
  Australia belong to the families Trachinidæ, Atherinidæ, Mugillidæ, Siluridæ, Homalopteræ,
  Haplochitonidæ, Galaxidæ, Osteoglossidæ, Symbranchidæ, and Sirenoidei; most of the genera being
  peculiar. The large and widely-distributed families, Cyprinodontidæ and Cyprinidæ, are absent. The
  most remarkable fish is the recently discovered <i>Ceratodus</i>, allied to the <i>Lepidosiren</i>
  of Tropical America, and <i>Protopterus</i> of Tropical Africa, the three species constituting the
  Sub-class Dipnoi, remains of which have been found fossil in the Triassic formation.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of Australian Vertebrata.</i>&mdash;In order to complete our general sketch of
  Australian zoology, and to afford materials for comparison with other regions, we will here
  summarize the distribution of Vertebrata in the entire Australian region, as given in detail in
  the tables at the end of this chapter. When an undoubted Oriental family or genus extends to
  Celebes only we do not count it as belonging to the Australian region, that island being so very
  anomalous and intermediate in character.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page398">{398}</span></div>

  <p>The Australian region, then, possesses examples of 18 families of Mammalia, 8 of which are
  peculiar; 71 of Birds, 16 being peculiar; 31 of Reptiles, 4 being peculiar; 11 of Amphibia, with 1
  peculiar; and 11 of Fresh-water fish, with 1 peculiar. In all, 142 families of Vertebrates, 30 of
  which are almost or quite confined to it, or between one-fourth and one-fifth of the whole
  number.</p>

  <p>The genera of Mammalia occurring within the limits of this region are 70, of which 45 are
  almost, or quite, confined to it.</p>

  <p>Of Land-Birds there are 296 genera, 196 of which are equally limited. The proportion is in both
  cases very nearly five-eighths.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This shows a considerable deficiency both in families of Vertebrates and genera of
  Mammalia, as compared with the Oriental and Ethiopian regions; while in genera of Birds it is a
  little superior to the latter in total numbers, and considerably so in the proportion of peculiar
  types.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Supposed Land Connection between Australia and South America.</i></p>

  <p>We may now consider how far the different classes and orders of vertebrates afford indications
  that during past ages there has been some closer connection between Australia and South America
  than that which now exists.</p>

  <p>Among Mammalia we have the remarkable fact of a group of marsupials inhabiting South America,
  and extending even into the temperate regions of North America, while they are found in no other
  part of the globe beyond the limits of the Australian region; and this has often been held to be
  evidence of a former connection between the two countries. A preliminary objection to this view
  is, that the opossums seem to be rather a tropical group, only one species reaching as far as 42°
  south latitude on the west coast of South America; but whatever evidence we have which seems to
  require a former union of these countries shows that it took place, if at all, towards their cold
  southern limits, the tropical faunas on the whole showing no similarity. This is not a very strong
  objection, since climates may have changed in the south to as great an extent as we <span
  class="pagenum" id="page399">{399}</span>know they have in the north. Perhaps a more important
  consideration is, that <i>Didelphys</i> is a family type unknown in Australia; and this implies
  that the point of common origin is very remote in geological time. But the most conclusive fact is
  that in the Eocene and Miocene periods this very family, Didelphyidæ, existed in Europe, while it
  only appeared in America in the Post-pliocene or perhaps the Pliocene period; so that it is really
  an Old-World group, which, though long since extinct in its birthplace, has survived in America,
  to which country it is a comparatively recent emigrant. Primeval forms of marsupials we know
  abounded in Europe during much of the Secondary epoch, and no doubt supplied Australia with the
  ancestors of the present fauna. It is clear, therefore, that in this case there is not a particle
  of evidence for any former union between Australia and South America; while it is almost
  demonstrated that both derived their marsupials from a common source in the northern
  hemisphere.</p>

  <p>Birds offer us more numerous but less clearly defined cases of this kind. Among Passeres, the
  wonderful lyre bird (<i>Menura</i>) is believed by some ornithologists to be decidedly allied to
  the South American Pteroptochidæ, while others maintain that it is altogether peculiar, and has no
  such affinity. The Australian Pachycephalidæ have also been supposed to find their nearest allies
  in the American Vireonidæ, but this is, perhaps, equally problematical. That the mound-makers
  (Megapodiidæ) of the Australian region are more nearly allied to the South American curassows
  (Cracidæ) than to any other family, is perhaps better established; but if proved, it is probably
  due, as in the case of the marsupials, to the survival of an ancient and once wide-spread type,
  and thus lends no support to the theory of a land connection between the two regions. A recent
  author, Professor Garrod, classes <i>Phaps</i> and other Australian genera of pigeons along with
  <i>Zenaida</i> and allied South American forms; but here again the affinity, if it exists, is so
  remote that the explanation already given will suffice to account for it. There remain only the
  penguins of the genus <i>Eudyptes</i>; and these have almost certainly passed from one region to
  the other, but <span class="pagenum" id="page400">{400}</span>no actual land connection is
  required for birds which can cross considerable arms of the sea.</p>

  <p>Reptiles again seem to offer no more support to the view than do mammalia or birds. Among
  snakes there are no families in common that have not a very wide distribution. Among lizards the
  Gymnopthalmidæ are the only family that favour the notion, since they are found in Australia and
  South America, but not in the Oriental region. Yet they occur in both the Palæarctic and Ethiopian
  regions, and their distribution is altogether too erratic to be of any value in a case of this
  kind; and the same remarks apply to the tortoises of the family Chelydidæ.</p>

  <p>The Amphibia, however, furnish us with some more decided facts. We have first the family of
  tree-frogs, Pelodryade, confined to the two regions; <i>Litoria</i>, a genus of the family Hylidæ
  peculiar to Australia, but with one species in Paraguay; and in the family Discoglossidæ, the
  Australian genus <i>Chiroleptes</i> has its nearest ally in the Chilian genus
  <i>Calyptocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>Fresh-water fishes give yet clearer evidence. Three groups are exclusively found in these two
  regions; <i>Aphritis</i>, a fresh-water genus of Trachinidæ, has one species in Tasmania and two
  others in Patagonia; the Haplochitonidæ inhabit only Terra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands and
  South Australia; while the genus <i>Galaxias</i> (forming the family Galaxidæ) is confined to
  South Temperate America, Australia, and New Zealand. We have also the genus <i>Osteoglossum</i>
  confined to the tropical rivers of Eastern South America, the Indo-Malay Islands and
  Australia.</p>

  <p>It is important here to notice that the heat-loving Reptilia afford hardly any indications of
  close affinity between the two regions, while the cold-enduring amphibia and fresh-water fish,
  offer them in abundance. Taking this fact in connection with the absence of all indications of
  close affinity among the mammalia and terrestrial birds, the conclusion seems inevitable that
  there has been no land-connection between the two regions within the period of existing species,
  genera, or families. Yet some interchange of amphibia and fresh-water <span class="pagenum"
  id="page401">{401}</span>fishes, as of plants and insects, has undoubtedly occurred, but this has
  been effected by other means. If we look at a globe we see at once how this interchange may have
  taken place. Immediately south of Cape Horn we have the South Shetland Islands and Graham's land,
  which is not improbably continuous, or nearly so, with South Victoria land immediately to the
  south of New Zealand. The intervening space is partly occupied by the Auckland, Campbell, and
  Macquaries' Islands, which, there is reason to believe are the relics of a great southern
  extension of New Zealand. At all events they form points which would aid the transmission of many
  organisms; and the farthest of the Macquaries' group, Emerald Island, is only 600 miles from the
  outlying islets of Victoria land. The ova of fish will survive a considerable time in the air, and
  the successful transmission of salmon ova to New Zealand packed in ice, shows how far they might
  travel on icebergs. Now there is evidently some means by which ova or young fishes are carried
  moderate distances, from the fact that remote alpine lakes and distinct river systems often have
  the same species. Glaciers and icebergs generally have pools of fresh water on their surfaces; and
  whatever cause transmits fish to an isolated pond might occasionally stock these pools, and by
  this means introduce the fishes of one southern island into another. Batrachians, which are
  equally patient of cold, might be transported by similar means; while, as Mr. Darwin has so well
  shown, (<i>Origin of Species</i>, 6th Ed. p. 345) there are various known modes by which plants
  might be transmitted, and we need not therefore be surprised that botanists find a much greater
  similarity between the production of the several Southern lands and islands, than do zoologists.
  It is important to notice that, however this intercommunication was effected, it has continued
  down to the epoch of existing species; for Dr. Günther finds the same species of fresh-water fish
  (<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>) inhabiting Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and Temperate
  South America; while another species is common to New Zealand and the Auckland Islands. We cannot
  believe that a land connection has existed between all these remote lands within the period of
  existence of this one species of fish, <span class="pagenum" id="page402">{402}</span>not only on
  account of what we know of the permanence of continents and deep oceans, but because such a
  connection must have led to much more numerous and important cases of similarity of natural
  productions than we actually find. And if within the life of <i>species</i> such interchange may
  have taken place across seas of greater or less extent, still more easy is it to understand, how,
  within the life of <i>genera</i> and <i>families</i>, a number of such interchanges may have
  occurred; yet always limited to those groups whose conditions of life render transmission
  possible. Had an actual land connection existed within the temperate zone, or during a period of
  warmth in the Antarctic regions, there would have been no such strict limitations to the
  inter-migration of animals. It may be held to support the view that floating ice has had
  <i>some</i> share in the transmission of fish and amphibia, when we find that in the case of the
  narrow tropical sea dividing Borneo from Celebes and the Moluccas, no proportionate amount of
  transmission has taken place, but numerous species, genera, and whole families, terminate abruptly
  at what we have other reasons for believing to be the furthest limits of an ancient continent. We
  can hardly suppose, however, that this mode of transmission would have sufficed for such groups as
  tree-frogs, which are inhabitants of the more temperate or even warm portions of the two southern
  lands. Some of these cases may perhaps be explained by the supposition of a considerable extent of
  land in the South-Temperate and Antarctic regions now submerged, and by a warm or temperate
  climate analogous to that which prevailed in the Arctic regions during some part of the Miocene
  epoch; while others may be due to cases of survival in the two areas of once wide-spread groups, a
  view supported in the case of the Amphibia by the erratic manner in which many of the groups are
  spread over the globe.</p>

  <p>From an examination of the facts presented by the various classes of vertebrates, we are, then,
  led to the conclusion, that there is no evidence of a former land-connection between the
  Australian and Neotropical regions; but that the various scattered resemblances in their natural
  productions <span class="pagenum" id="page403">{403}</span>that undoubtedly occur, are probably
  due to three distinct causes.</p>

  <p>First, we have the American Didelphyidæ, among Mammals, and the Cracidæ, among birds, allied
  respectively to the Marsupials and the Megapodiidæ of Australia. This is probably more a
  coincidence than an affinity, due to the preservation of ancient wide-spread types in two remote
  areas, each cut off from the great northern continental masses, in which higher forms were evolved
  leading to the extinction of the lower types. In each of these southern isolated lands the
  original type would undergo a special development; in the one case suited to an arboreal
  existence, in the other to a life among arid plains.</p>

  <p>The second case is that of the tree-frogs, and the genus <i>Osteoglossum</i> among fishes; and
  is most likely due to the extension and approximation of the two southern continents, and the
  existence of some intermediate lands, during a warm period when facilities would be afforded for
  the transmission of a few organisms by the causes which have led to the exceptional diffusion of
  fresh-water productions in all parts of the world. As however <i>Osteoglossum</i> occurs also in
  the Sunda Islands, this may be a case of survival of a once wide-spread group.</p>

  <p>The third case is that of the same genera and even species of fish, and perhaps of frogs, in
  the two countries; which may be due to transmission from island to island by the aid of floating
  ice, with or without the assistance of more intervening lands than now exist.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Having arrived at these conclusions from a consideration of the vertebrata, we
  shall be in a position to examine how far the same causes will explain, or agree with, the
  distribution of the invertebrate groups, or elucidate any special difficulties we may meet with in
  the relations of the sub-regions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Insects.</i></p>

  <p>The insects of the Australian region are as varied, and in some respects as peculiar as its
  higher forms of life. As we have already indicated in our sketch of the Oriental region, a vast
  number of forms inhabit the Austro-Malay sub-region <span class="pagenum"
  id="page404">{404}</span>which are absent from Australia proper. Such of these as are common to
  the Malay archipelago as a whole, have been already noted; we shall here confine ourselves more
  especially to the groups peculiar to the region, which are almost all either Australian or
  Austro-Malayan, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand being very poor in insect life.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;Australia itself is poor in butterflies, except in its northern and
  more tropical parts, where green <i>Ornithopteræ</i> and several other Malayan forms occur. In
  South Australia there are less than thirty-five species, whereas in Queensland there are probably
  over a hundred. The peculiar Australian forms are few. In the family Satyridæ, <i>Xenica</i> and
  <i>Heteronympha</i>, with <i>Hypocista</i> extending to New Guinea; among the Lycænidæ,
  <i>Ogyris</i> and <i>Utica</i> are confined to Australia proper, and <i>Hypochrysops</i> to the
  region; and in Papilionidæ, the remarkable <i>Eurycus</i> is confined to Australia, but is allied
  to <i>Euryades</i>, a genus found in Temperate South America (La Plata), and to the
  <i>Parnassius</i> of the North-Temperate zone.</p>

  <p>The Austro-Malay sub-region has more peculiar forms. <i>Hamadryas</i>, a genus of Danaidæ,
  approximates to some South American forms; <i>Hyades</i> and <i>Hyantis</i> are remarkable groups
  of Morphidæ; <i>Mynes</i> and <i>Prothoë</i> are fine Nymphalidæ, the former extending to
  Queensland; <i>Dicallaneura</i>, a genus of Erycinidæ, and <i>Elodina</i>, of Pieridæ, are also
  peculiar forms. The fine <i>Ægeus</i> group of <i>Papilio</i>, and <i>Priamus</i> group of
  <i>Ornithoptera</i>, also belong exclusively to this region.</p>

  <p><i>Xois</i> is confined to the Fiji Islands, <i>Bletogona</i> to Celebes, and
  <i>Acropthalmia</i> to New Zealand, all genera of Satyridæ. Seventeen genera in all are confined
  to the Australian region.</p>

  <p>Among the Sphingina, <i>Pollanisus</i>, a genus of Zygænidæ, is Australian; also four genera of
  Castniidæ&mdash;<i>Synemon</i>, <i>Euschemon</i>, <i>Damias</i>, and <i>Cocytia</i>, the latter
  being confined to the Papuan islands. The occurrence of this otherwise purely South American
  family in the Australian region, as well as the affinity of <i>Eurycus</i> and <i>Euryades</i>
  noticed above, is interesting; but as we have seen that the genera and families of insects are
  more permanent than those of the higher animals, and as the groups in question are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page405">{405}</span>confined to the warmer parts of both countries, they may
  be best explained as cases of survival of a once wide-spread type, and may probably date back to
  the period when the ancestors of the Marsupials and Megapodii were cut off from the rest of the
  world.</p>

  <p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The same remark applies here as in the Lepidoptera, respecting the
  affinity of the Austro-Malay fauna to that of Indo-Malay Islands; but Australia proper is much
  richer in beetles than in butterflies, and exhibits much more speciality. Although the other two
  parts of the Australian region (Polynesia and New Zealand) are very poor in beetles, it will,
  nevertheless, on the whole compare favourably with any of the regions except the very richest.</p>

  <p>Cicindelidæ are not very abundant. <i>Therates</i> and <i>Tricondyla</i> are the characteristic
  genera in Austro-Malaya, but are absent from Australia, where we have <i>Tetracha</i> as the most
  characteristic genus, with one species of <i>Megacephala</i> and two of <i>Distypsidera</i>, a
  genus which is found also in New Zealand and some of the Pacific Islands. The occurrence of the
  South American genus, <i>Tetracha</i>, may perhaps be due to a direct transfer by means of
  intervening lands during the warm southern period; but considering the permanence of coleopterous
  forms (as shown by the Miocene species belonging almost wholly to existing genera), it seems more
  probable that it is a case of the survival of a once wide-spread group.</p>

  <p>Carabidæ are well represented, there being no less than 94 peculiar genera, of which 19 are
  confined to New Zealand. The Australian genera of most importance are <i>Carenum</i> (68 species),
  <i>Promecoderus</i> (27 species), <i>Silphomorpha</i> (32 species), <i>Adelotopus</i> (27
  species), <i>Scaraphites</i> (25 species), <i>Notonomus</i> (18 species), <i>Gnathoxys</i> (12
  species), <i>Eutoma</i> (9 species), <i>Ænigma</i> (15 species), <i>Lacordairea</i> (8 species),
  <i>Pamborus</i> (8 species), <i>Catadromus</i> (4 species),&mdash;the latter found in Australia
  and Celebes. Common to Australia and New Zealand are <i>Mecodema</i> (14 species),
  <i>Homalosoma</i> (32 species), <i>Dicrochile</i> (12 species), and <i>Scopodes</i> (5 species).
  The larger genera, confined to New Zealand only, are <i>Metaglymma</i> (8 species), and
  <i>Demetrida</i> (3 species). The curious genus <i>Pseudomorpha</i> (10 species), is divided
  between California, Brazil, <span class="pagenum" id="page406">{406}</span>and Australia; and the
  Australian genera, <i>Adelotopus</i>, <i>Silphomorpha</i>, and <i>Sphallomorpha</i>, form with it
  a distinct tribe of Coleoptera. These being all confined to the warmer regions, and having so
  scattered a distribution, are no doubt the relics of a widespread group. The Australian genus,
  <i>Promecoderus</i>, has, however, closely allied genera (<i>Cascelius</i> and its allies), in
  Chili and Patagonia; while two small genera confined to the Auckland Islands
  (<i>Heterodactylus</i> and <i>Pristancyclus</i>) are allied to a group found only in
  Terra-del-Fuego and the Falkland Islands, (<i>Migadops</i>); and in these cases we may well
  believe that a direct transmission has taken place by some of the various means already
  indicated.</p>

  <p>In Lucanidæ, Australia is only moderately rich, having 7 peculiar genera. The most important
  are <i>Ceratognathus</i> and <i>Rhyssonotus</i>, confined to Australia; <i>Lissotes</i> to
  Australia and New Zealand; <i>Lamprima</i> to Australia and Papua. <i>Mitophyllus</i> and
  <i>Dendroblax</i> inhabit New Zealand only; while <i>Syndesus</i> is found in Australia, New
  Caledonia, and tropical South America.</p>

  <p>The beautiful Cetoniidæ are poorly represented, there being only 3 peculiar
  genera;&mdash;<i>Schizorhina</i>, mainly Australian, but extending to Papua and the Moluccas;
  <i>Anacamptorhina</i>, confined to New Guinea, and <i>Sternoplus</i> to Celebes. <i>Lomaptera</i>
  is very characteristic of the Austro-Malay Islands. This almost tropical family shows no
  approximations between the Australian and Neotropical faunas.</p>

  <p>In Buprestidæ, the Australian region is the richest, possessing no less than 47 genera, of
  which 20 are peculiar to it. Of these, 15 are peculiar to Australia itself, the most important
  being <i>Stigmodera</i> (212 species), <i>Ethon</i> (13 species), and <i>Nascio</i> (3 species);
  <i>Cisseis</i> (17 species), and the magnificent <i>Calodema</i> (3 species), are common to
  Australia and Austro-Malaya; while <i>Sambus</i> (10 species) and <i>Anthaxomorpha</i> (4
  species), with some smaller groups, are peculiarly Austro-Malayan. In this family occur several
  points of contact with the Neotropical region. <i>Stigmodera</i> is said to have a species in
  Chili, while there are undoubtedly several allied genera in Chili and South Temperate America. The
  genus <i>Curis</i> has 5 Australian and 3 Chilian species, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page407">{407}</span><i>Acherusia</i> has 2 species in Brazil, 1 in Australia. These
  resemblances may probably have arisen from intercommunication during the warm southern period,
  when floating timber would occasionally transmit a few larvæ of this family from island to island
  across the antarctic seas. When the cold period returned, they would spread northward, and become
  more or less modified under the new physical conditions and organic competition, to which they
  were subjected.</p>

  <p>We now come to the very important group of Longicorns, in which the Australian region as a
  whole, is very rich, possessing 360 genera, of which 263 are peculiar to it. Of these about 50 are
  confined to the Austro-Malay Islands, 12 to New Zealand, and the remainder to Australia proper
  with Tasmania. Of the genera confined to, or highly characteristic of Australia, the following are
  the most important:&mdash;<i>Cnemoplites</i>, belonging to the Prionidæ; <i>Phoracantha</i>, to
  the Cerambycidæ; <i>Zygocera</i>, <i>Hebecerus</i>, <i>Symphyletes</i>, and <i>Rhytidophora</i>,
  to the Lamiidæ. Confined to the Austro-Malay Islands are <i>Tethionea</i> (Cerambycidæ):
  <i>Tmesisternus</i>, <i>Arrhenotus</i>, <i>Micracantha</i>, and <i>Sybra</i> (Lamiidæ); but there
  are also such Malayan genera as <i>Batocera</i>, <i>Gnoma</i>, <i>Praonetha</i>, and
  <i>Sphenura</i>, which are very abundant in the Austro-Malay sub-region. A species of each of the
  Australian genera, <i>Zygocera</i>, <i>Syllitus</i>, and <i>Pseudocephalus</i>, is said to occur
  in Chili, and one of the tropical American genus, <i>Hammatochærus</i>, in tropical Australia; an
  amount of resemblance which, as in the case of the Buprestidæ, may be imputed to trans-oceanic
  migration during the Southern warm period. This concludes our illustrations of the distribution of
  some of the more important groups of Australian insects; and it will be admitted that we have not
  met with any such an amount of identity with the fauna of Temperate South America, as to require
  us to modify the conclusions we arrived at from a consideration of the vertebrate groups.</p>

  <p><i>Land-Shells.</i>&mdash;The distribution of many of the larger genera of land-shells is very
  erratic, while others are exceedingly restricted, so that it requires an experienced conchologist
  to investigate the affinities of the several groups, and thus work <span class="pagenum"
  id="page408">{408}</span>out the important facts of distribution. All that can be done here is to
  note the characteristic and peculiar genera, and any others presenting features of special
  interest.</p>

  <p>In the great family of the snails (Helicidæ), the only genera strictly confined to the region
  are, <i>Partula</i>, now containing above 100 species, and ranging over the Pacific from the
  Solomon Isles on the west, to the Sandwich Islands and Tahiti on the east; and <i>Achatinella</i>,
  now containing nearly 300 species, and wholly confined to the Sandwich Islands. <i>Pfeifferia</i>
  is confined to the Philippine Islands and Moluccas; <i>Cochlostyla</i> to the Indo-Malay Islands
  and Australia; <i>Bulimus</i> occurs in most of the insular groups, including New Zealand, but is
  absent from Australia.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Among the Aciculidæ, the widely-scattered <i>Truncatella</i> is the only genus
  represented. Among Diplommatinidæ, <i>Diplommatina</i> is the characteristic genus, ranging over
  the whole region, and found elsewhere as far as India, with one species in Trinidad. The extensive
  family Cyclostomidæ, is not well represented. Seven genera reach the Austro-Malay Islands, one of
  which, <i>Registoma</i>, is confined to the Philippines, Moluccas, New Caledonia, and the Marshall
  Islands. <i>Omphalotropis</i> is the most characteristic genus, ranging over the whole region;
  <i>Callia</i> is confined to the Philippines, Ceram, and Australia; <i>Realia</i> to New Zealand
  and the Marquesas. The genus <i>Helicina</i> alone represents the Helicinidæ, and is found in the
  whole region except New Zealand. The number of species known from Australia is perhaps about 300;
  while the Polynesian sub-region, according to Mr. Harper Pease, contains over 600; the
  Austro-Malay Islands will furnish probably 200; and New Zealand about 100; making a total of about
  1,200 species for the whole region.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Australian Sub-regions.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">Few of the great zoological regions comprise four divisions so strongly contrasted
  as these, or which present so many interesting problems. We have first the Austro-Malay Islands,
  an equatorial forest-region teeming with varied and beautiful forms of life; next we have
  Australia itself, an island-continent with its satellite <span class="pagenum"
  id="page409">{409}</span>Tasmania, both tropical and temperate, but for the most part arid, yet
  abounding in peculiar forms in all the classes of animals; then come the Polynesian Islands,
  another luxuriant region of tropical vegetation, yet excessively poor in most of the higher groups
  of animals as well as in some of the lower; and lastly, we have New Zealand, a pair of temperate
  forest-clad islands far in the southern ocean, with a very limited yet strange and almost wholly
  peculiar fauna. We have now to consider the general features and internal relations of the faunas
  of each of these sub-regions, together with any external relations which have not been discussed
  while treating the region as a whole.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>I. Austro-Malayan Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>The central mass on which almost every part of this sub-region is clearly dependent, is the
  great island of New Guinea, inhabited by the Papuan race of mankind; and this, with the
  surrounding islands, which are separated from it by shallow seas and possess its most marked
  zoological features, are termed Papua. A little further away lie the important groups of the
  Moluccas on one side and the Eastern Papuan Islands on the other, which possess a fauna mainly
  derivative from New Guinea, yet wanting many of its distinctive types; and, in the case of the
  Moluccas possessing many groups which are not Australian, but derived from the adjacent Oriental
  region. To the south of these we have the Timor group, whose fauna is clearly derivative, from
  Australia, from Java, and from the Moluccas. Lastly comes Celebes, whose fauna is most complex and
  puzzling, and, so far as we can judge, not fundamentally derivative from any of the surrounding
  islands.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Papua, or the New Guinea Group.</i>&mdash;New Guinea is very deficient in
  Mammalia as compared with Australia, though this apparent poverty may, in part, depend on our very
  scanty knowledge. As yet only four of the Australian families of Marsupials are known to inhabit
  it, with nine genera, several of which are peculiar. It also possesses a peculiar form of wild
  pig; but as yet no other non-marsupial terrestrial mammal has been discovered, except a rat,
  described by Dr. Gray as <i>Uromys <span class="pagenum" id="page410">{410}</span>aruensis</i>,
  but about the locality of which there seems some doubt.<a id="NtA_13"

  <p>We have here no sign of any approach to the Mammalian fauna of the Oriental region, for though
  <i>Sus</i> has appeared, the Muridæ (rats and mice) seem to be wanting.</p>

  <p>In Birds the case is very different, since we at once meet with important groups, either
  wholly, or almost peculiar to the Papuan fauna. According to a careful estimate, embodying the
  recent discoveries of Meyer and D'Albertis, there are 350 species of Papuan land-birds comprised
  in 136 genera. About 300 of the species are absolutely peculiar to the district, while 39 of the
  genera are exclusively Papuan or just extend into the Moluccas, or into North Australia where it
  closely approaches New Guinea. In analysing the genera we may set aside 31 as having a wide range,
  and being of no significance in distribution; such are most of the birds of prey, with the genera
  <i>Hirundo</i>, <i>Caprimulgus</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>; and others widely spread in both the
  Oriental and Australian regions, as <i>Dicæum</i>, <i>Munia</i>, <i>Eudynamis</i>, &amp;c. Of the
  remainder, as above stated, about 39 are peculiar to the Papuan fauna, 50 are characteristic
  Australian genera; 9 are more especially Malayan, and as much Australian as Oriental; while 7
  only, appear to be typically Oriental with a discontinuous distribution, none of them occurring in
  the Moluccas.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page411">{411}</span></div>

  these several classes of generic types.</p>

  <p>The above six birds are very important as indicating past changes in the Austro-Malay Islands,
  and we must say a few words about each. (1) <i>Eupetes</i> is very remarkable, since the New
  Guinea birds resemble in all important characters that which is confined to Malacca and Sumatra.
  They are probably the survivors of a once wide-spread Malayan group. (2) <i>Alcippe</i> or
  <i>Drymocataphus</i> (for in which genus the birds should be placed is doubtful) seems another
  clear case of a typical Indo-Malayan form occurring in New Guinea and Java, but in no intervening
  island. (3) <i>Pomatorhinus</i> is a most characteristic Himalayan and Indo-Malayan genus,
  occurring again in New Guinea and also in Australia, but in no intermediate island. The New Guinea
  bird seems as nearly related to Oriental as Australian species. (4) <i>Arachnothera</i> is exactly
  parallel to <i>Alcippe</i>, occurring nowhere east of Borneo except in New Guinea. (5)
  <i>Prionochilus</i>, a small black bird, sometimes classed as a distinct genus, but evidently
  allied to the <i>Prionochili</i> of the Indo-Malay Islands. (6) <i>Eulabes</i>, the genus which
  contains the well known Mynahs of India, extends east of Java as far as Flores, but is not found
  in Celebes or the Moluccas. The two New Guinea species are sometimes classed in different genera,
  but they are undoubtedly allied to the Mynahs of India and Malaya.</p>

  <p>We find then, that while the ornithology of New Guinea is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page413">{413}</span>preeminently Australian in character and possesses many peculiar
  developments of Australian types, it has also&mdash;as might be expected from its geographical
  position, its climate, and its vegetation&mdash;received an infusion of Malayan forms. But while
  one group of these is spread over the whole Archipelago, and occasionally beyond it, there is
  another group which presents the unusual and interesting feature of discontinuous distribution,
  jumping over a thousand miles of island-studded sea from Java and Borneo to New Guinea itself. It
  is a parallel case to that of Java in the Oriental region, which we have already discussed, but
  the suggested explanation in that case is more difficult to apply here. The recent soundings by
  the <i>Challenger</i> show us, that although the several islands of the Moluccas are surrounded by
  water from 1,200 to 2,800 fathoms deep, yet these seas form inclosed basins with rims not more
  than from 400 to 900 fathoms deep, suggesting the idea of great lakes or inland seas which have
  sunk down bodily with the surrounding land, or that enormous local and restricted elevations and
  subsidences have here occurred. We have also the numerous small islands and coral banks south of
  Celebes and eastward towards Timor-Laut and the Aru Islands, indicating great subsidence; and it
  is possible that there was an extension of Papua to the west, approaching sufficiently near to
  Java to receive occasional straggling birds of Indo-Malay type, altogether independent of the
  Moluccas to the north.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Bright Colours and Ornamental Plumage of New Guinea Birds.</i>&mdash;One of the
  most striking features of Papuan ornithology is the large proportion which the handsome and
  bright-coloured birds bear to the more obscure species. That this is really the case has been
  ascertained by going over my own collections, made at Aru and New Guinea, and comparing them with
  my collection made at Malacca&mdash;a district remarkable for the number of handsome birds it
  produces. Using, as nearly as possible, the same standard of beauty, about one-third of the
  Malacca birds may be classed as handsome,<a id="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> while in
  Papua the proportion comes out exactly one-half. This is due, in part to the great abundance of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page414">{414}</span>parrots, cockatoos, and lories, almost all of which
  are beautiful; and of pigeons, more than half of which are very beautiful; as well as to the
  numerous kingfishers, most of which are excessively brilliant. Then we have the absence of
  thrushes, and the very small numbers of the warblers, shrikes, and Timaliidæ, which are
  dull-coloured groups; and, lastly, the presence of numerous gay pittas, flycatchers, and the
  unequalled family of paradise-birds. A large number of birds adorned with metallic plumage is also
  a marked feature of this fauna, more than a dozen genera being so distinguished. Among the
  remarkable forms are <i>Peltops</i>, a flycatcher, long classed as one of the Indo-Malayan
  Eurylæmidæ, which it resembles both in bill and coloration; <i>Machærirhynchus</i>, curious little
  boat-billed flycatchers; and <i>Todopsis</i>, a group of terrestrial flycatchers with the
  brilliant colours of <i>Pitta</i> or <i>Malurus</i>. The paradise-birds present the most wonderful
  developments of plumage and the most gorgeous varieties of colour, to be found among passerine
  birds. The great whiskered-swift, the handsomest bird in the entire family, has its head-quarters
  here. Among kingfishers the elegant long-tailed <i>Tanysipteræ</i> are preeminent, whether for
  singularity or beauty. Among parrots, New Guinea possesses the great black cockatoo, one of the
  largest and most singular birds in the order; <i>Nasiterna</i>, the smallest of known parrots; and
  <i>Charmosyna</i>, perhaps the most elegant. Lastly, among the pigeons we have the fine
  crowned-pigeons, the largest and most remarkable group of the order.</p>

  <p><i>Plate X. Illustrating the Ornithology of New Guinea.</i>&mdash;The wonderful ornithological
  fauna we have just sketched, could only be properly represented in a series of elaborate coloured
  plates. We are obliged here to confine ourselves to representing a few of the more remarkable
  types of form, as samples of the great number that adorn this teeming bird-land. The large central
  figure is the fine twelve-wired paradise-bird (<i><span class="correction"
  title="&quot;Epimachus&quot; in printed work, corrected
  by Errata">Seleucides</span> albus</i>), one of the most beautiful and remarkable of the family.
  Its general plumage appears, at first sight, to be velvety black; but on closer examination, and
  by holding the bird in various lights, it is found that every part of it glows with the most
  exquisite metallic tints&mdash;rich bronze, intense violet, and, on the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page415">{415}</span>edges of the breast-feathers, brilliant green. An immense tuft of dense
  plumes of a fine orange-buff colour, springs from each side of the body, and six of these on each
  side terminate in a black curled rachis or shaft, which form a perfectly unique adornment to this
  lovely bird. To appreciate this wonderful family (of which no good mounted collection exists) the
  reader should examine the series of plates in Mr. Elliot's great work on the Paradiseidæ, where
  every species is figured of the size of life, and with a perfection of colouring that leaves
  little to be desired.</p>

  <p>Below the <i><span class="correction" title="&quot;Epimachus&quot; in printed work, corrected
  by Errata">Seleucides</span></i> is one of the elegant racquet-tailed king-hunters (<i>Tanysiptera
  galatea</i>) whose plumage of vivid blue and white, and coral-red bill, combined with the long
  spatulate tail, renders this bird one of the most attractive of the interesting family of
  kingfishers. On a high branch is seated the little Papuan parroquet (<i>Charmosyna papuensis</i>),
  one of the Trichoglossidæ, or brush-tongued parrots,&mdash;richly adorned in red and yellow
  plumage, and with an unusually long and slender tail. On the ground is the well-known crowned
  pigeon (<i>Goura coronata</i>), a genus which is wholly confined to New Guinea and a few of the
  adjacent islands. One of the very few Papuan mammals, a tree-kangaroo (<i>Dendrolagus
  inustus</i>), is seated on a high branch. It is interesting, as an arboreal modification of a
  family which in Australia is purely terrestrial; and as showing how very little alteration of form
  or structure is needed to adapt an animal to such a different mode of life.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;Of these classes comparatively little is at present known,
  but there is evidence that the same intermixture of Oriental and Australian forms that occurs in
  birds and insects, is also found here. Dr. A. B. Meyer, the translator of this work into German,
  and well known for his valuable discoveries in New Guinea, has kindly furnished me with a
  manuscript list of Papuan reptiles, from which most of the information I am able to give is
  derived.</p>

  <p>Of Snakes, 24 genera, are known, belonging to 11 families. Six of the genera are
  Oriental,&mdash;<i>Calamaria</i>, <i>Cerberus</i>, <i>Chrysopelea</i>, <i>Lycodon</i>,
  <i>Chersydrus</i>, and <i>Ophiophagus</i>. Four are Australian,&mdash;<i>Morelia</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page416">{416}</span><i>Liasis</i>, <i>Diemenia</i>, and <i>Acanthophis</i>;
  while four others are more especially Papuan,&mdash;<i>Dibamus</i> (Typhlopidæ),
  <i>Brachyorros</i>&mdash;a sub-genus of the wide-spread <i>Rhabdosoma</i> (Calamariidæ), found
  also in Timor; <i>Nardoa</i> and <i>Enygrus</i> (Pythonidæ), ranging from the Moluccas to the Fiji
  Islands. The rest are either common to the Oriental and Australian regions or of wide range.</p>

  <p>Of Lizards also, 24 genera are recorded, belonging to 5 families. Three only are peculiarly
  Oriental,&mdash;<i>Eumeces</i>, <i>Tiaris</i>, and <i>Nycteridium</i>; but another,
  <i>Gonyocephalus</i>, is Malayan, ranging from Java and Borneo to the Pelew Islands. Three are
  Australian,&mdash;<i>Cyclodus</i>, <i>Heteropus</i>, and <i>Gehyra</i>; while six are especially
  Papuan,&mdash;<i>Keneuxia</i> (extending to the Philippines), <i>Elania</i>, <i>Carlia</i> (to
  North Australia), <i>Lipinia</i> (to the Philippine Islands), and <i>Tribolonotus</i>,&mdash;all
  belonging to the Scincidæ; and <i>Arua</i> belonging to the Agamidæ. We must add
  <i>Cryptoblepharus</i>, which is confined to the Australian region, except a species in Mauritius.
  The other genera have a wider distribution.</p>

  <p>The preponderant Oriental element in the snakes as compared with the lizards, is suggestive of
  the dispersal of the former being dependent on floating trees, or even on native canoes, which for
  an unknown period have traversed these seas, and in which various species of snakes often secrete
  themselves. This seems the more probable, as snakes are usually more restricted in their range
  than lizards, and exhibit less numerous examples of widespread genera and species. The other
  orders of reptiles present no features of interest.</p>

  <p>Of Amphibia only 8 genera are known, belonging to 6 families. <i>Rana</i>, <i>Hylarana</i>, and
  <i>Hyla</i> are wide-spread genera, the former being, however, absent from Australia.
  <i>Hyperolius</i>, <i>Pelodryas</i>, <i>Litoria</i>, and <i>Asterophrys</i> are Australian; while
  <i>Platymantis</i> is Polynesian, with a species in the Philippine Islands. Hence it appears that
  the amphibia, so far as yet known, exhibit no Oriental affinity; and this is a very suggestive
  fact. We have seen (p. 29) that salt water is almost a complete barrier to the dispersal of these
  creatures; so that the wholly Australian character of the Papuan batrachia is what we might
  expect, if, as here advocated, no actual land connection between <span class="pagenum"
  id="page417">{417}</span>the Oriental and Australian regions, has probably occurred during the
  entire Tertiary and Post-tertiary periods.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The general character of the Papuan insects has been sufficiently
  indicated in our sketch of the Entomology of the region. We will here only add, that the metallic
  lustre so prevalent among the birds, is also apparent in such insects as <i>Sphingnotus
  mirabilis</i>, a most brilliant metallic Longicorn; <i>Lomaptera wallacei</i> and
  <i>Anacamptorhina fulgida</i>, Cetonii of intense lustre; <i>Calodema wallacei</i> among the
  Buprestidæ; and the elegant blue <i>Eupholi</i> among the weevils. Even among moths we have
  <i>Cocytia durvillii</i>, remarkable for its brilliant metallic colours.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>The Moluccas.</i>&mdash;The islands of Gilolo, Bouru, and Ceram, with several smaller
  islands adjacent, together with Sanguir, and perhaps Tulour or Salibaboo to the north-west, and
  the islands from Ke to Timor-Laut to the south-east, form the group of the Moluccas or
  Spice-Islands, remarkable for the luxuriance of their vegetation and the extreme beauty of their
  birds and insects. Their Mammalia are of Papuan character, with some foreign intermixture. Two
  genera of the New Guinea marsupials, <i>Belideus</i> and <i>Cuscus</i>, abound; and we have also
  the wide-spread <i>Sus</i>. But besides these, we find no less than five genera of placental
  Mammals quite foreign to the Papuan or Australian faunas. These are 1. <i>Cynopithecus
  nigrescens</i>, found only in the small island of Batchian, and probably introduced from Celebes,
  where the same ape occurs. 2. <i>Viverra tangalunga</i>, a common Indo-Malayan species of civet,
  probably introduced. 3. <i>Cervus hippelaphus</i>, var. <i>Moluccensis</i>, a deer abundant in all
  the islands, very close to a Javan species and almost certainly introduced by man, perhaps very
  long ago. 4. <i>Babirusa alfurus</i>, the babirusa, found only in the island of Bouru, and perhaps
  originally introduced from Celebes. 5. <i>Sorex</i> sp., small shrews. With the exception of the
  last, <i>all</i> these species are animals habitually domesticated and kept in confinement by the
  Malays; and when we consider that none of the smaller Mammalia of Java and Borneo, numbering at
  least fifty different species, are found <span class="pagenum" id="page418">{418}</span>in any of
  the Moluccas, we can hardly suppose that such large animals as the deer and ape, could have
  reached them by natural means. There is every reason to believe, therefore, that the indigenous
  Mammalia of the Moluccas are wholly of Papuan stock, and very limited in number.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The birds are much more varied and interesting. About 200 species of land-birds are
  now known, belonging to 85 genera. Of the species about 15 are Indo-Malayan, 32 Papuan, and about
  140 peculiar. Of the genera only two are peculiar,&mdash;<i>Semioptera</i>, a paradise bird, and
  <i>Lycocorax</i>, a singular form of Corvidæ; but there is also a peculiar rail-like wader,
  <i>Habroptila</i>. One genus, <i>Basilornis</i>, is found only in Ceram and Celebes; another,
  <i>Scythrops</i>, is Australian, and perhaps a migrant. About 30 genera are characteristic Papuan
  types, and 37 others, of more or less wide range, are found in New Guinea and were therefore
  probably derived thence. There remains a group of birds which are not found in New Guinea, and are
  either Palæarctic or Oriental. These are 13 in number as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Of these the <i>Monticola</i>, found only in Gilolo, appears to be a straggler or migrant from
  the Philippine islands. <i>Acrocephalus</i>, of which four species occur, is a wide-spread group;
  one of the Moluccan birds is an Australian and another a North-Asian species, which perhaps
  indicates that there has long been some migration southward from island to island, across the
  Moluccas. <i>Cisticola</i> is a genus of very wide range, extending to Australia. <i>Hypolais</i>
  is probably a modified form of a Chinese or Javanese species. <i>Criniger</i> is a pure Indo-Malay
  form, represented here by three fine species. <i>Butalis</i> is a Chinese species, no doubt
  straggling southward. <i>Budytes</i> and <i>Corydalla</i> are widespread Oriental and Palæarctic
  species or slight modifications of them. <i>Hydrornis</i> is a Malayan form of Pittidæ.
  <i>Batrachostomus</i> is a distinct representative of a purely Indo-Malay genus. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page419">{419}</span><i>Loriculus</i> is Malayan, and especially Philippine,
  but it reaches as far as Mysol. <i>Treron</i> is here at its eastern limit, and is represented in
  Bouru and Ceram by one of the most beautiful species. <i>Neopus</i>, a Malayan eagle, is said to
  occur in the Moluccas. We find then only three characteristic Indo-Malay types in the
  Moluccas,&mdash;<i>Criniger</i>, <i>Batrachostomus</i>, and <i>Treron</i>. All are represented by
  distinct and well marked species, indicating a somewhat remote period since their ancestors
  entered the district, but all are birds of considerable powers of flight, so that a very little
  extension of the islands in a south-westerly direction would afford the means of transmission, but
  this could not well have been by way of Celebes, because the two former genera are unknown in that
  island.</p>

  <p>It is evident, therefore, that the Moluccas are wholly Papuan in their zoology; yet they are no
  less clearly derivative, and must have obtained their original immigrants under conditions that
  rendered a full representation of the fauna impossible. Such remarkable and dominant types as the
  eleven genera of Paradiseidæ, with <i>Cracticus</i>, <i>Rectes</i>, <i>Todopsis</i>,
  <i>Machærirhynchus</i>, <i>Gerygone</i>, <i>Dacelo</i>, <i>Podargus</i>, <i>Cyclopsitta</i>,
  <i>Microglossum</i>, <i>Nasiterna</i>, <i>Chalcopsitta</i>, and <i>Goura</i>,&mdash;all
  characteristic Papuan groups, found in almost all the islands and most of them very abundant, are
  yet totally absent from the Moluccas. Taking this, in conjunction with the absence of the two
  genera of Papuan kangaroos and the other smaller groups of marsupials, and we must be convinced
  that the Moluccas cannot be mere fragments of the old Papuan land, or they would certainly, in
  some one or other of their large and fertile islands, have preserved a more complete
  representation of the parent fauna. Most of the Moluccan birds are very distinct from the allied
  species of New Guinea; and this would imply that the entrance of the original forms took place at
  a remote period. The two peculiar genera with clearly Papuan affinities, show the same thing. The
  cassowary, found only in the large island of Ceram and distinct from any Papuan species, would
  however seem to have required a land connection for its introduction, almost as much as any of the
  larger mammalia.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page420">{420}</span></div>

  <p>Taking all the facts into consideration, I would suggest as the most probable explanation, that
  if the Moluccas ever formed part of the main Papuan land, they were separated at an early date,
  and subsequently so greatly submerged as to destroy a large proportion of their fauna. They have
  since risen, and have probably been larger than at present, and rather more closely approximated
  to the parent land, whence they received a considerable immigration of such animals as were
  adapted to cross narrow seas. This gave them several Papuan forms, but still left them without a
  number of the types more especially confined to the forest depths, or powerful enough to combat
  the gales which often blow weaker flyers out to sea. Most of the birds whose absence from the
  Moluccas is so conspicuous belong to one or other of these classes.</p>

  <p>Among the most characteristic birds of the Moluccas are the handsome crimson lories of the
  genera <i>Lorius</i> and <i>Eos</i>. These are found in every island (but not in Celebes or the
  Timor group); and a fine species of <i>Eos</i>, peculiar to the small islands of Siau and Sanguir,
  just north of Celebes, obliges us to place these with the Moluccas instead of with the former
  island, to which they seem most naturally to belong. The crimson parrots of the genus
  <i>Eclectus</i> are almost equally characteristic of the Moluccas, and add greatly to the
  brilliancy of the ornithology of these favoured islands.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;The Reptiles, so far as known, appear to agree in their distribution
  with the other vertebrates. In some small collections from Ceram there were no less than six of
  the genera peculiar to the Australian region, and which were before only known from Australia
  itself. These are, of snakes, <i>Liasis</i> and <i>Enygrus</i>, genera of Pythonidæ; with
  <i>Diemenia</i> and <i>Acanthophis</i> (Elapidæ); of lizards, <i>Cyclodus</i>, a genus of
  Scincidæ; and of Amphibia, a tree-frog of the genus <i>Pelodryas</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Insects&mdash;Peculiarities of the Moluccan Fauna.</i>&mdash;In insects the Moluccas are
  hardly, if at all, inferior to New Guinea itself. The islands abound in grand <i>Papilios</i> of
  the largest size and extreme beauty; and it is a very remarkable fact, that when the
  closely-allied species of the Moluccas and New Guinea are compared, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page421">{421}</span>the former are almost always the largest. As examples may be mentioned,
  <i>Ornithoptera priamus</i> and <i>O. helena</i> of the Moluccas, both larger than the varieties
  (or species) of Papua; <i>Papilio ulysses</i> and <i>deiphobus</i> of Amboyna, usually larger than
  their allies in New Guinea; <i>Hestia idea</i>, the largest species of the genus; <i>Diadema
  pandarus</i> and <i>Charaxes euryalus</i>, both larger than any other species of the same genera
  in the whole archipelago. It is to be noted also, that in the Moluccas, the very largest specimens
  or races seem always to come from the small island of Amboyna; even those of Ceram, the much
  larger island to which it is a satellite, being almost always of less dimensions. Among
  Coleoptera, the Moluccas produce <i>Euchirus longimanus</i>, one of the largest and most
  remarkable of the Lamellicornes; <i>Sphingnotus dunningi</i>, the largest of the Austro-Malayan
  Tmesisterninæ; a <i>Sphenura</i>, the largest and handsomest of an extensive genus; an unusually
  large <i>Schizorhina</i> (Cetoniidæ); and some of the most remarkable and longest-horned
  Anthotribidæ. Even in birds the same law may be seen at work,&mdash;in the <i>Tanysiptera nais</i>
  of Ceram, which has a larger tail than any other in the genus; in <i>Centropus goliath</i> of
  Gilolo, being the largest and longest-tailed species; in <i>Hydrornis maximus</i> of Gilolo, the
  largest and perhaps the most elegantly and conspicuously coloured of all the Pittidæ; in
  <i>Platycercus amboinensis</i>, being pre-eminent in its ample blue tail; in the two Moluccan
  lories and <i>Eos rubra</i>, being more conspicuously red than the allied New Guinea species; and
  in <i>Megapodius wallacei</i> of Bouru, being the only species of the genus conspicuously marked
  and banded.</p>

  <p>All these examples, of larger size, of longer tails or other appendages, and of more
  conspicuous colouring, are probably indications of a less severe struggle for existence in these
  islands than in the larger tract of New Guinea, with a more abundant and more varied fauna; and
  this may apply even to the smaller islands, as compared with the larger in the immediate vicinity.
  The limited number of forms in the small islands compared with a similar area in the parent land,
  implies, perhaps, less competition and less danger; and thus allows, where all other conditions
  are favourable, an unchecked and continuous <span class="pagenum"
  id="page422">{422}</span>development in size, form, and colour, until they become positively
  injurious. This law may not improbably apply to the New Guinea fauna itself, as compared with that
  of Borneo or any other similar country; and some of its peculiarities (such as its wonderful
  paradise-birds) may be due to long isolation, and consequent freedom from the influence of any
  competing forms. The difference between the very sober colours of the Coleoptera, and in a less
  degree of the birds, of Borneo, as compared with their brilliancy in New Guinea, always struck me
  most forcibly, and was long without any, even conjectural, explanation. It is not the place here
  to go further into this most curious and interesting subject. The reader who wishes for additional
  facts to aid him in forming an opinion, should consult Mr. Darwin's <i>Descent of Man</i>,
  chapters x. to xv.; and my own <i>Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection</i>, chapters
  iii. and iv.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Timor Group.</i>&mdash;<i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;In the group of islands between Java and
  Australia, from Lombok to Timor inclusive, we find a set of mammals similar to those of the
  Moluccas, but some of them different species. A wide-spread species of <i>Cuscus</i> represents
  the Papuan element. A <i>Sorex</i> and a peculiar species of wild pig, we may also accept as
  indigenous. Three others have almost certainly been introduced. These are, (1.) <i>Macacus
  cynomolgus</i>, the very commonest Malay monkey, which may have crossed the narrow straits from
  island to island between Java and Timor, though it seems much more probable that it was introduced
  by Malays, who constantly capture and rear the young of this species. (2.) <i>Cervus
  timoriensis</i>, a deer, said to be a distinct species, inhabits Timor, but it is probably only a
  variety of the <i>Cervus hippelaphus</i> of Java. This animal is, however, much more likely to
  have crossed the sea than the monkey. (3.) <i>Paradoxurus fasciatus</i>, takes the place of
  <i>Viverra tangalunga</i> in the Moluccas, both common and wide-spread civets which are often kept
  in confinement by the Malays. The <i>Felis megalotis</i>, long supposed to be a native of Timor,
  has been ascertained by Mr. Elliot to belong to a different country altogether.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The birds are much more interesting, since they are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page423">{423}</span>sufficiently numerous to allow us to determine their relations, and trace
  their origin, with unusual precision. There are 96 genera and 160 species of land-birds known to
  inhabit this group of islands; and on a careful analysis, they are found to be almost equally
  related to the Australian and Oriental regions, 30 genera being distinctly traceable to the
  former, and the same number to the latter. Their connection with the Moluccas is shown by the
  presence of the genera <i>Mimeta</i>, <i>Geoffroyus</i>, <i>Cacatua</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, and
  <i>Ianthænas</i>, together with <i>Megapodius</i> and <i>Cerchneis</i> represented by Moluccan
  species. <i>Turac&#x0153;na</i> shows a connection with Celebes, and <i>Scops</i> is represented
  by a Celebesian species. The connection with Australia is shown by the genera <i>Sphæcothera</i>,
  <i>Gerygone</i>, <i>Myiagra</i>, <i>Pardalotus</i>, <i>Gliciphila</i>, <i>Amadina</i>, and
  <i>Aprosmictus</i>; while <i>Milvus</i>, <i>Hypotriorchis</i>, <i>Eudynamis</i>, and
  <i>Eurystomus</i>, are represented by Australian species. Other genera confined to or
  characteristic of the Australian region, are <i>Rhipidura</i>, <i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Artamus</i>,
  <i>Campephaga</i>, <i>Pachycephala</i>, <i>Philemon</i>, <i>Ptilotis</i>, and <i>Myzomela</i>.</p>

  <p>Such genera as <i>Merops</i> and <i>Strix</i>, which are as much Australian as Oriental, are
  inserted here because they are represented by Javan species. The list is considerably swelled by
  genera which have reached Lombok across the narrow strait from Baly, but have passed no further.
  Such are <i>Zoothera</i>, <i>Orthotomus</i>, <i>Pycnonotus</i>, <i>Pericrocotus</i> and
  <i>Strix</i>. A much larger number (12) stop short at Flores, leaving only 13, indicated in the
  list by (T) after their names, which reach Timor. It is evident, therefore, that these islands
  have been stocked from three chief sources,&mdash;the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page424">{424}</span>Moluccas (with New Guinea and Celebes,) Australia, and Java. The Moluccan
  forms may well have arrived as stragglers from island to island, aided by whatever facilities have
  been afforded by lands now submerged. Most of the remainder have been derived either from
  Australia or from Java; and as their relations to these islands are very interesting, they must be
  discussed with some detail.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Origin of the Timorese Fauna.</i>&mdash;We must first note, that 80 species, or
  exactly one-half of the land-birds of the islands, are peculiar and mostly very distinct,
  intimating that the immigration commenced long enough back to allow of much specific modification.
  There is also one peculiar genus of kingfishers, <i>Caridonax</i>, found only in Lombok and
  Flores, and more allied to Australian than to Oriental types. The fine white-banded pigeons (s. g.
  <i>Leucotreron</i>) are also almost peculiar; one other less typical species only being known, a
  native of N. Celebes. In order to compare the species with regard to their origin, we must first
  take away those of wide distribution from which no special indications can be obtained. In this
  case 49 of the land-birds must be deducted, leaving 111 species which afford good materials for
  comparison. These, when traced to their origin, show that 62 came from some part of the Australian
  region, 49 from Java or the Oriental region. But if we divide them into two groups, the one
  containing the species identical with those of the Australian or Oriental regions, the other
  containing <i>allied</i> or <i>representative</i> species peculiar to the islands, we have the
  following result:</p>

  <table class="sp3 mc" title="Timorese Fauna" summary="Timorese Fauna">
    <tr>
      <td>Species common to the Timorese Islands and the Oriental Region</td>
      <td>30</td>

      <td class="pl4">Total</td>
      <td class="bt">62</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>This table is very important, as indicating that the connection <span class="pagenum"
  id="page425">{425}</span>with Australia was probably earlier than that with Java; since the
  majority of the Australian species have become modified, while the majority of the Oriental
  species have remained unchanged. This is due, no doubt, in part to the continued immigration of
  fresh individuals from Java, after that from Australia, the Moluccas and New Guinea had almost
  wholly ceased. We must also notice the very small proportion of the genera, either of Australia or
  Java, that have found their way into these islands, many of the largest and most wide-spread
  groups in both countries being altogether absent. Taking these facts into consideration, it is
  pretty clear that there has been no close and long-continued approximation of these islands to any
  part of the Australian region; and it is also probable that they were fairly stocked with such
  Australian groups as they possess before the immigration from Java commenced, or a larger number
  of characteristic Oriental forms would have been able to have established themselves.</p>

  <p>On looking at our map, we find that a shallow submerged bank extends from Australia to within
  about twenty miles of the coast of Timor; and this is probably an indication that the two
  countries were once only so far apart. This would have allowed the purely Australian types to
  enter, as they are not numerous; there being about 6 Australian species, and 10 or 12
  representatives of Australian species, in Timor. All the rest may have been derived from the
  Moluccas or New Guinea, being mostly wide-spread genera of the Australian region; and the
  extension of Papua in a south-west direction towards Java (which was suggested as a means of
  providing New Guinea with peculiar Indo-Malay types not found in any other part of the region) may
  have probably served to supply Timor and Flores with the mass of their Austro-Malayan genera
  across a narrow strait or arm of the sea. Lombok, Baly, and Sumbawa were probably not then in
  existence, or nothing more than small volcanic cones rising out of the sea, thus leaving a
  distance of 300 miles between Flores and Java. Subsequently they grew into islands, which offered
  an easy passage for a number of Indo-Malay genera into such scantily stocked territories as Flores
  and Timor. The <span class="pagenum" id="page426">{426}</span>north coast of Australia then sank,
  cutting off the supply from that country; and this left the Timorese group in the position it now
  occupies.</p>

  <p>The reptiles and fishes of this group are too little known to enable us to make any useful
  comparison.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The insects, though not numerous, present many fine species, some quite
  unlike any others in the Archipelago. Such are&mdash;<i>Papilio liris</i>, <i>Pieris læta</i>,
  <i>Cirrochroa lamarckii</i> and <i>C. leschenaultii</i> among butterflies. The Coleoptera are
  comparatively little known, but in the insects generally the Indo-Malay element predominates. This
  may have arisen from the peculiar vegetation and arid climate not being suitable to the Papuan
  insects. Why Australian forms did not establish themselves we cannot conjecture; but the field
  appears to have been open to immigrants from Java, the climate and vegetation of which island at
  its eastern extremity approximates to that of the Timorese group. The insects are, however, so
  peculiarly modified as to imply a very great antiquity, and this is also indicated by a group of
  Sylviine birds here classed under <i>Oreicola</i>, but some of which probably form distinct
  genera. There may, perhaps, have been an earlier and a later approximation to Java, which, with
  the other changes indicated, would account for most of the facts presented by the fauna of these
  islands. One deduction is, at all events, clear: the extreme paucity of indigenous mammals along
  with the absence of so many groups of birds, renders it certain that the Timorese islands did not
  derive their animal life by means of an actual union with any of the large islands either of the
  Australian or the Oriental regions.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Celebes Group.</i>&mdash;We now come to the Island of Celebes, in many respects the most
  remarkable and interesting in the whole region, or perhaps on the globe, since no other island
  seems to present so many curious problems for solution. We shall therefore give a somewhat full
  account of its peculiar fauna, and endeavour to elucidate some of the causes to which its
  zoological isolation may be attributed.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The following is the list of the mammalia of <span

  <p>The first&mdash;a large black ape&mdash;is itself an anomaly, since it is not closely allied to
  any other form of quadrumana. Its flat projecting muzzle, large superciliary crests and maxillary
  ridges, with the form and appearance of its teeth, separate it altogether from the genus
  <i>Macacus</i>, as represented in the Indo-Malay islands, and ally it closely to the baboons of
  Africa.<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> We have already seen reason to suppose
  that it has been carried to Batchian, and there is some doubt about the allied species or variety
  (<i>C. niger</i>) of the Philippines being really indigenous there; in which case this interesting
  form will remain absolutely confined to Celebes. (2.) The tarsier is a truly Malayan species, but
  it is said to occur in a small island at the northern extremity of Celebes<span class="correction"
  title="aded by Errata"> and on some of the Philippine Islands</span>. It might possibly have been
  introduced there. (3) and (4)&mdash;a civet and a deer&mdash;are, almost certainly, as in the
  Moluccas, introduced species. (5.) <i>Anoa depressicornis.</i> This is one of the peculiar
  Celebesian types; a small straight-horned wild-bull, anatomically allied to the buffaloes, and
  somewhat resembling the bovine antelopes of Africa, but having no near allies in the Oriental
  region. (6.) <i>Sus Celebensis</i>; a peculiar species of wild-pig. (7.) <i>Babirusa alfurus</i>;
  another remarkable type, having no near allies. It differs in its dentition from the typical
  Suidæ, and seems to approach the African Phacoch&#x0153;ridæ, The manner in which the canines of
  the upper <span class="correction" title="&quot;tusks&quot; in printed work, corrected by
  Errata">jaw</span> are reversed, and grow directly upwards in a spiral curve over the eyes, is
  unique among mammalia. (8.) Five squirrels inhabit Celebes, and all are peculiar species. (9.)
  These are forest rats of the sub-genus <i>Gymnomys</i>, allied to Australian species. 10.
  <i>Cuscus.</i> This typical <span class="pagenum" id="page428">{428}</span>Australian form is
  represented in Celebes by two peculiar species.</p>

  <p>Leaving out the Indo-Malay <i>species</i>, which may probably have been introduced by man, and
  are at all events comparatively recent immigrants, and the wild pig, a genus which ranges over the
  whole archipelago and which has therefore little significance, we find two genera which have come
  from the Australian side,&mdash;<i>Cuscus</i> and <i>Mus</i>; and four from the Oriental
  side,&mdash;<i>Cynopithecus</i>, <i>Anoa</i>, <i>Babirusa</i>, and <i>Sciurus</i>. But
  <i>Sciurus</i> alone corresponds to <i>Cuscus</i>, as a genus still inhabiting the adjacent
  islands; the other three being not only peculiar to Celebes, but incapable of being affiliated to
  any specially Oriental group. We seem, then, to have indications of two distinct periods; one very
  ancient, when the ancestors of the three peculiar genera roamed over some unknown continent of
  which Celebes formed, perhaps, an outlying portion;&mdash;another more recent, when from one side
  there entered <i>Sciurus</i>, and from the other <i>Cuscus</i>. But we must remember that the
  Moluccas to the east, possess scarcely any indigenous mammals except <i>Cuscus</i>; whereas Borneo
  and Java on the west, have nearly 50 distinct genera. It is evident then, that the facilities for
  immigration must have been much less with the Oriental than with the Australian region, and we may
  be pretty certain that at this later period there was no land connection with the Indo-Malay
  islands, or some other animals than squirrels would certainly have entered. Let us now see what
  light is thrown upon the subject by the birds.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The total number of birds known to inhabit Celebes is 205, belonging to
  about 150 genera. We may leave out of consideration the wading and aquatic birds, most of which
  are wide-ranging species. There remain 123 genera and 152 species of land-birds, of which 9 genera
  and 66 species are absolutely confined to the island, while 20 more are found also in the Sula or
  Sanguir Islands, so that we may take 86 to be the number of peculiar Celebes species. Lord Walden,
  from whose excellent paper on the birds of Celebes (<i>Trans. Zool. Soc.</i> vol. viii. p. 23)
  most of these figures are obtained, estimates, that of the species which are not peculiar to
  Celebes, 55 are of Oriental and 22 of <span class="pagenum" id="page429">{429}</span>Australian
  origin, the remainder being common to both regions. This shows a preponderant recent immigration
  from the West and North, which is not to be wondered at when we look at the long coast line of
  Java, Borneo, and the Philippine islands, with an abundant and varied bird population, on the one
  side, and the small scattered islands of the Moluccas, with a comparatively scanty bird-fauna, on
  the other.</p>

  <p class="sp4">But, adopting the method here usually followed, let us look at the relations of the
  <i>genera</i> found in Celebes, omitting for the present those which are peculiar to it. I divide
  these genera into two series:&mdash;those which are found in Borneo or Java but not in the
  Moluccas, and those which inhabit the Moluccas and not Borneo or Java; these being the respective
  sources from which, <i>primâ facie</i>, the species of these genera must have been derived. Genera
  which range widely into both these districts are rejected, as teaching us nothing of the origin of
  the Celebesian fauna. In a few cases, sub-genera which show a decided eastern or western origin,
  are given.</p>

  <p>These tables show a decided preponderance of Oriental over Australian forms. But we must
  remember that the immediately adjacent lands from whence the supply was derived, is <span

  <p>If we reckon the absent families to be each represented by only two important genera, we shall
  find the deficiency on the Oriental side much the greatest; yet those on the side of the Moluccas
  are sufficiently remarkable. The Meliphagidæ are not indeed absolutely wanting, since a
  <i>Myzomela</i> has now been found in Celebes; but all its larger and more powerful forms which
  range over almost the entire region, are absent. This may be balanced by the absence of the
  excessively abundant Timaliidæ of the Indo-Malay islands, which are represented by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page431">{431}</span>only a single species; and by the powerful Phasianidæ,
  represented only by the common Malay jungle fowl, perhaps introduced. The entire absence of
  Pycnonotidæ is a very anomalous fact, since one of the largest genera, <i>Criniger</i>, is well
  represented in several islands of the Moluccas, and one has even been found in the Togian islands
  in the great northern inlet of Celebes; but yet it passes over Celebes itself. <i>Ceyx</i>, a
  genus of small kingfishers, is a parallel case, since it is found everywhere from India to New
  Guinea, leaving out only Celebes; but this comes among those curiosities of the Celebesian fauna
  which we shall notice further on. In the list of genera derived from Borneo or Java, no less than
  6 are represented by identical species (indicated by sp. after the name); while in the Moluccan
  list 5 are thus identical. These must be taken to indicate, either that the genus is a recent
  introduction, or that stragglers still occasionally enter, crossing the breed, and thus preventing
  specific modification. In either case they depend on the existing state of things, and throw no
  light on the different distribution of land and sea which aided or checked migration in former
  times; and they therefore to some extent diminish the weight of the Indo-Malay affinity, as
  measured by the relations of the peculiar species of Celebes.</p>

  <p>From our examination of the evidence thus far,&mdash;that is, taking account firstly, of the
  <i>species</i>, and, secondly, of the <i>genera</i>, which are common to Celebes and the groups of
  islands between which it is situated, we must admit that the connexion seems rather with the
  Oriental than with the Australian region; but when we take into account the <i>proportion</i> of
  the genera and species present, to those which are absent, and giving some weight to the greater
  extent of coast line on the Indo-Malay side, we seem justified in stating that the Austro-Malay
  element is rather the most fully represented. This result applies both to birds and mammals; and
  it leads us to the belief, that during the epoch of existing species and genera, Celebes has never
  been united with any extensive tract of land either on the Indo-Malay or Austro-Malay side, but
  has received immigrants from both during a very long period, the facilities for immigration having
  been rather the <span class="pagenum" id="page432">{432}</span>greatest on the Austro-Malay or
  Australian side. We have now to consider what further light can be thrown on the subject by the
  consideration of the <i>peculiar genera</i> of Celebes, and of those curiosities or anomalies of
  distribution to which we have referred.</p>

  <p>Nine genera of birds are altogether peculiar to Celebes; three more are found only in one other
  island, and seem to be typically Celebesian; while one is found in the Sula islands (which belongs
  to the Celebes group) and probably exists in Celebes also. The following is a list of these 13
  genera:</p>

  </table>

  <p>Of the above, <i>Artamides</i>, <i>Monachalcyon</i>, <i>Cittura</i>, and <i>Megacephalon</i>,
  are modifications of types characteristic of the Australian region. All are peculiar to Celebes
  except <i>Cittura</i>, found also in the Sanguir islands to the northward, but which seems to
  belong to the Moluccan group. <i>Streptocitta</i>, <i>Charitornis</i>, and <i>Gazzola</i>, are
  peculiar types of Corvidæ; the two former allied to the magpies, the latter to the jackdaws.
  <i>Charitornis</i> is known only from the Sula islands east of Celebes, and is closely related to
  <i>Streptocitta</i>. There is nothing comparable to these three groups in any of the Malay
  islands, and they seem to have relations rather with the Corvidæ of the old-world northern
  continent. <i>Basilornis</i>, <i>Enodes</i>, and <i>Scissirostrum</i>, are remarkable forms of
  Sturnidæ. <i>Basilornis</i> has a beautiful compressed crest, which in the allied species found in
  Ceram is elongated behind. <i>Enodes</i> has remarkable red superciliary streaks, but seems allied
  to <i>Calornis</i>. <i>Scissirostrum</i> seems also allied to <i>Calornis</i> in general
  structure, but has a very peculiarly formed bill and nostrils. We can hardly say whether these
  three forms show more affinity to Oriental or to Australian types, but they add to the weight of
  evidence as to the great antiquity and isolation of the Celebesian fauna. <i>Scissirostrum</i> has
  been classed with <i>Euryceros</i>, a <span class="pagenum" id="page433">{433}</span>Madagascar
  bird, and with <i>Buphaga</i>, an African genus; but the peculiar beak and nostrils approximate
  more to <i>Cracticus</i> and its allies, of the Australian region, which should probably form a
  distinct family. <i>Ceycopsis</i> is undoubtedly intermediate between the Malayan <i>Ceyx</i> and
  the African <i>Ispidina</i>, and is therefore especially interesting. <i>Meropogon</i> is a
  remarkable form of bee-eater, allied to the Indo-Malayan <i>Nyctiornis</i>. <i>Prioniturus</i>
  (the raquet-tailed parrots) of which two species inhabit Celebes, and one the Philippines, appears
  to be allied to the Austro-Malayan <i>Geoffroyus</i>.</p>

  <p>We must finally notice a few genera found in Celebes, whose nearest allies are not in the
  surrounding islands, and which thus afford illustrations of discontinuous distribution. The most
  remarkable, perhaps, is <i>Coracias</i>, of which a fine species inhabits Celebes; while the genus
  is quite unknown in the Indo-Malay sub-region, and does not appear again till we reach Burmah and
  India; and the species has no closer affinity for Indian than for African forms.
  <i>Myialestes</i>, a small yellow flycatcher, is another exmple; its nearest ally (<i>M.
  cinereocapilla</i>) being a common Indian bird, but unknown in the Malay islands. The Celebesian
  bird described by me as <i>Prionochilus aureolimbatus</i>, is probably a third case of
  discontinuous distribution, if (as a more careful examination seems to show) it is not a
  <i>Prionochilus</i>, but congeneric with <i>Pachyglossa</i>, a bird only found in the Himalayas.
  The fine pigeon, <i>Carpophaga forsteni</i>, belongs to a group found in the Philippines,
  Australia, and New Zealand; but the Celebes species is very distinct from all the others, and
  seems, if anything, more allied to that of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>The Sula islands (Sula-mangola, Sula-taliabo, and Sula-besi) lie midway between Celebes and the
  Moluccas, being 80 miles from the nearest part of Celebes, with several intervening islands, and
  40 miles from Bouru, all open sea. Their birds show, as might be expected, a blending of the two
  faunas, but with a decided preponderance of that of Celebes. Out of 43 land birds which have been
  collected in these islands, we may deduct 6 as of wide range and no significance. Of the 37
  remaining, 21 are Celebesian species, and 4 are new species but <span class="pagenum"
  id="page434">{434}</span>allied to those of Celebes; while there are 10 Moluccan species and 2 new
  species allied to those of the Moluccas. It is curious that no less than 3 Moluccan genera, quite
  unknown in Celebes itself, occur here,&mdash;<i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Pachycephala</i>, and
  <i>Criniger</i>; but all these, as well as several other of the Moluccan birds, are rather weak
  flyers, and such as are likely to have been carried across by strong winds. Of the <i>genera</i>,
  23 are from Celebes, 10 from the Moluccas. These facts show, that the Sula islands form part of
  the Celebes group, although they have received an infusion of Moluccan forms, which will perhaps
  in time spread to the main island, and diminish the remarkable individuality that now
  characterises its fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Of the reptiles and fishes of Celebes we have not sufficient information
  to draw any satisfactory conclusions. I therefore pass to the insects of which something more is
  known.</p>

  <p>The Butterflies of Celebes are not very numerous, less than 200 species in all having been
  collected; but a very large proportion of them, probably three-fourths of the whole, are peculiar.
  There is only one peculiar genus, <i>Amechania</i>, allied to <i>Zethera</i> (a group confined to
  the Philippine Islands), with which it should perhaps be united. Most of the genera are of wide
  distribution in the archipelago, or are especially Malayan, only two truly Australian genera,
  <i>Elodina</i> and <i>Acropthalmia</i>, reaching Celebes. On the other hand, 7 peculiar Oriental
  genera are found in Celebes, but not further east, viz., <i>Clerome</i>, <i>Adolias</i>,
  <i>Euripus</i>, <i>Apatura</i>, <i>Limenitis</i>, <i>Iolaus</i>, and <i>Leptocircus</i>. There are
  also several indications of a direct affinity with the continent rather than with Malaya, as in
  the cases already enumerated among birds. A fine butterfly, yet unnamed, almost exactly resembles
  <i>Dichorragia nesimachus</i>, a Himalayan species. <i>Euripus robustus</i> is closely allied to
  <i>E. halitherses</i> of N. India; there are no less than 5 species of <i>Limenitis</i>, all quite
  unlike those found in other parts of the archipelago. The butterflies of Celebes are remarkably
  distinguished from all others in the East, by peculiarities of form, size, and colour, which run
  through groups of species belonging to different genera. Many Papilionidæ and Pieridæ, and some
  <span class="pagenum" id="page435">{435}</span>Nymphalidæ, have the anterior wings elongated, with
  the apex often acute, and, what is especially remarkable, an abrupt bend or shoulder near the base
  of the wing. (See <i>Malay Archipelago</i>, 3rd Ed. p. 281, woodcut.) No less than 13 species of
  <i>Papilio</i>, 10 Pieridæ, and 4 or 5 Nymphalidæ, are thus distinguished from their nearest
  allies in the surrounding islands or in India. In size again, a large number of Celebesian
  butterflies stand preeminent over their allies. The fine Papilios&mdash;<i>adamantius</i>,
  <i>blumei</i>, and <i>gigon</i>&mdash;are perfect giants by the side of the closely-allied forms
  of Java; while <i>P. androcles</i> is the largest and longest-tailed, of all the true
  swallow-tailed group of the Old World. Among Nymphalidæ, the species of <i>Rhinopalpa</i> and
  <i>Euripus</i>, peculiar to Celebes, are immensely larger than their nearest allies; and several
  of the Pieridæ are also decidedly larger, though in a less marked degree. In colour, many of the
  Celebesian butterflies differ from the nearest allied species; so that they acquire a singularity
  of aspect which marks them off from the rest of the group. The most curious case is that of three
  butterflies, belonging to three distinct genera (<i>Cethosia myrina</i>, <i>Messaras mæonides</i>,
  and <i>Atella celebensis</i>) all having a delicate violet or lilac gloss in lines or patches,
  which is wholly wanting in every allied species of the surrounding islands. These numerous
  peculiarities of Celebesian butterflies are very extraordinary; and imply isolation from
  surrounding lands, almost as much as do the strange forms of mammals and birds, which more
  prominently characterise this interesting island.</p>

  <p>Of the Coleoptera we know much less, but a few interesting facts may be noted. There are a
  number of fine species of <i>Cicindela</i>, some of peculiar forms; and one <i>Odontochila</i>, a
  South American genus; while <i>Collyris</i> reaches Celebes from the Oriental region. In Carabidæ
  it has one peculiar genus, <i>Dicraspeda</i>; and a species of the fine Australian genus
  <i>Catadromus</i>. In Lucanidæ it has the Oriental genus, <i>Odontolabris</i>. In Cetoniidæ it has
  a peculiar genus, <i>Sternoplus</i>, and several fine <i>Cetoniæ</i>; but the characteristic
  Malayan genus, <i>Lomaptera</i>, found in every other island of the archipelago from Sumatra to
  New Guinea, is absent&mdash;an analogous fact to the case of <i>Ceyx</i> among birds. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page436">{436}</span>In Buprestidæ, the principal Austro-Malay genus,
  <i>Sambus</i>, is found here; while <i>Sponsor</i>, a genus 8 species of which inhabit Mauritius,
  has one species here and one in New Guinea. In Longicorns there are four peculiar genera,
  <i>Comusia</i>, <i>Pytholia</i>, <i>Bityle</i>, and <i>Ombrosaga</i>; but the most important
  features are the occurrence of the otherwise purely Indo-Malayan genera <i>Agelasta</i>,
  <i>Nyctimene</i>, and <i>Astathes</i>; and of the purely Austro-Malayan <i>Arrhenotus</i>,
  <i>Trysimia</i>, <i>Xenolea</i>, <i>Amblymora</i>, <i>Diallus</i>, and <i>Ægocidnus</i>. The
  remaining genera range over both portions of the archipelago. In the extensive family of
  Curculionidæ we can only notice the elegant genus, <i>Celebia</i>, allied to <i>Eupholus</i>,
  which, owing to its abundance and beauty, is a conspicuous feature in the entomology of the
  island.</p>

  <p><i>Origin of the fauna of Celebes.</i>&mdash;We have now to consider, briefly, what past
  changes of physical geography are indicated by the curious assemblage of facts here adduced. We
  have evidently, in Celebes, a remnant of an exceedingly ancient land, which has undergone many and
  varied revolutions; and the stock of ancient forms which it contains must be taken account of,
  when we speculate on the causes that have so curiously limited more recent immigrations. Going
  back to the arrival of those genera which are represented in Celebes by peculiar species, and
  taking first the Austro-Malay genera, we find among them such groups as <i>Zon&#x0153;nas</i>
  (s.g.), <i>Phlog&#x0153;nas</i>, <i>Leucotreron</i> (s.g.), and <i>Turac&#x0153;na</i>, which are
  not found in the Moluccas at all; and <i>Myzomela</i>, found in Timor and Banda, but not in Ceram
  or Bouru, which are nearest to Celebes. This, combined with the curious absence of so many of the
  commonest Moluccan genera, leads to the conclusion that the Austro-Malay immigration took place by
  way of Timor and the southern part of New Guinea. It will be remembered, that to account for the
  Indo-Malayan forms in New Guinea, we suggested an extension of that country in a westerly
  direction just north of Timor. Now this is exactly what we require, to account for the stocking of
  Celebes with the Australian forms it possesses. At this time Borneo did not approach so near, and
  it was at a somewhat later period that the last great Indo-Malay migration set in; but <span
  class="pagenum" id="page437">{437}</span>finding the country already fairly stocked, comparatively
  few groups were able to establish themselves.</p>

  <p>Going back a little farther, we come to the entrance of those few birds and insects which
  belong to India or Indo-China; and this probably occurred at the same time as that continental
  extension southward, which we found was required to account for a similar phenomenon in Java.
  Celebes, being more remote, received only a few stragglers. We have now to go much farther back,
  to the time when the ancestors of the peculiar Celebesian genera entered the country, and here our
  conjectures must necessarily be less defined.</p>

  <p>On the Australian side we have to account for <i>Megacephalon</i>, and the other genera of
  purely Papuan type. It may perhaps be sufficient to say, that we do not yet know that these
  genera, or some very close allies, do not still exist in New Guinea; in which case they may well
  have entered at the same time with the species, already referred to. If, on the other hand, they
  are really as isolated as they appear to be, they represent an earlier communication, either by an
  approximation of the two islands over the space now occupied by the Moluccas; or, what is perhaps
  more probable, through a former extension of the Moluccas, which have since undergone so much
  subsidence, as to lead to the extinction of a large proportion of their ancient fauna. The
  wide-spread volcanic action, and especially the prevalence of raised coral-reefs in almost all the
  islands, render this last supposition very probable.</p>

  <p>On the Oriental side the difficulty is greater; for here we find, what seem to be clear
  indications of a connection with Africa, as well as with Continental Asia, at some immensely
  remote epoch. <i>Cynopithecus</i>, <i>Babirusa</i>, and <i>Anoa</i>; <i>Ceycopsis</i>,
  <i>Streptocitta</i>, and <i>Gazzola</i> (s. g.), and perhaps <i>Scissirostrum</i>, may be well
  explained as descendants of ancestral types in their respective groups, which also gave rise to
  the special forms of Africa on the one hand, and of Asia on the other. For this immigration we
  must suppose, that at a period before the formation of the present Indo-Malay Islands, a great
  tract of land extended in a north-westerly direction, till it met the old Asiatic continent. This
  may have been before <span class="pagenum" id="page438">{438}</span>the Himalayas had risen to any
  great height, and when a large part of what are now the cold plateaus of Central Asia may have
  teemed with life, some forms of which are preserved in Africa, some in Malaya, and a few in
  Celebes. Here may have lived the common ancestor of <i>Sus</i>, <i>Babirusa</i>, and
  <i>Phacoch&#x0153;rus</i>; as well as of <i>Cynopithecus</i>, <i>Cynocephalus</i>, and
  <i>Macacus</i>; of <i>Anoa</i> and <i>Bubalus</i>; of <i>Scissirostrum</i> and <i>Euryceros</i>;
  of <i>Ceyx</i>, <i>Ceycopsis</i>, and <i>Ispidina</i>. Such an origin accounts, too, for the
  presence of the North-Indian forms in Celebes; and it offers less difficulties than a direct
  connection with continental Africa, which once appeared to be the only solution of the problem. If
  this south-eastward extension of Asia occurred at the same time as the north-eastward extension of
  South Africa and Madagascar, the two early continents may have approached each other sufficiently
  to have allowed of some interchange of forms: <i>Tarsius</i> may be the descendant of some
  Lemurine animal that then entered the Malayan area, while the progenitors of <i>Cryptoprocta</i>
  may then have passed from Asia to Madagascar.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is true that we here reach the extremest limits of speculation; but when we have
  before us such singular phenomena as are presented by the fauna of the island of Celebes, we can
  hardly help endeavouring to picture to our imaginations by what past changes of land and sea (in
  themselves not improbable) the actual condition of things may have been brought about.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>II. Australia and Tasmania, or the Australian Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">A general sketch of Australian zoology having been given in the earlier part of
  this chapter, it will not be necessary to occupy much time on this sub-region, which is as
  remarkably homogeneous as the one we have just left is heterogeneous. Although much of the
  northern part of Australia is within the tropics, while Victoria and Tasmania are situated from
  36° to 43° south latitude, there is no striking change in the character of the fauna throughout
  the continent; a number of important genera extending over the whole country, and giving a very
  uniform character to its zoology. The eastern parts, including the colonies of New South Wales and
  Queensland, are undoubtedly the richest, several peculiar types being found only here. The
  southern portion is somewhat poorer, and has very few peculiar forms; and Tasmania being isolated
  is poorer still, yet its zoology has much resemblance to that of Victoria, from which country it
  has evidently not been very long separated. The north, as far as yet known, is characterised by
  hardly any peculiar forms, but by the occurrence of a number of Papuan types, which have evidently
  been derived from New Guinea.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page439">{439}</span></div>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The Australian sub-region contains about 160 species of Mammalia, of
  which 3 are Monotremata, 102 Marsupials, 23 Chiroptera, 1 Carnivora (the native dog, probably not
  indigenous), and 31 Muridæ. The north is characterised by a species of the Austro-Malayan genus
  <i>Cuscus</i>. <i>Phascolarctos</i> (the koala, or native bear) is found only in the eastern
  districts; <i>Phascolomys</i> (the wombat) in the south-east and Tasmania; <i>Petaurista</i> (a
  peculiar form of flying opossum) in the east. <i>Thylacinus</i> (the zebra-wolf), and
  <i>Sarcophilus</i> (the "native devil"), two carnivorous marsupials, are confined to Tasmania.
  West Australia, the most isolated and peculiar region botanically, alone possesses the curious
  little honey-eating <i>Tarsipes</i>, and the <i>Peragalea</i>, or native rabbit. The remarkable
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>, a small ant-eating marsupial, is found in the west and south; and
  <i>Onychogalea</i>, a genus of kangaroos, in West and Central Australia. All the other genera have
  a wider distribution, as will be seen by a reference to the list at the end of this chapter.</p>

  <p><i>Plate XI. A Scene in Tasmania, with Characteristic Mammalia.</i>&mdash;As some of the most
  remarkable Mammalia of the Australian region are now found only in Tasmania, we have chosen this
  island for the scene of our first illustration of the fauna of the Australian sub-region. The pair
  of large striped animals are zebra-wolves (<i>Thylacinus cynocephalus</i>), the largest and most
  destructive of the carnivorous marsupials. These creatures used to be tolerably plentiful in
  Tasmania, where they are alone found. They are also called "native tigers," or "native hyænas;"
  and being destructive to sheep, they have been destroyed by the farmers and will doubtless soon be
  exterminated. In the foreground on <span class="pagenum" id="page440">{440}</span>the left is a
  bandicoot (<i>Perameles gunnii</i>). These are delicate little animals allied to the kangaroos;
  and they are found in all parts of Australia, and Tasmania, to which latter country this species
  is confined. On the right is the wombat (<i>Phascolomys wombat</i>), a root-eating marsupial, with
  large incisor teeth like those of our rodents. They inhabit south-east Australia and Tasmania. In
  the foreground is the porcupine ant-eater (<i>Echidna setosa</i>), belonging to a distinct order
  of mammalia, Monotremata, of which the only other member is the duck-billed
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. These animals are, however, more nearly allied to the marsupials, than to
  the insectivora or edentata of the rest of the world, which in some respects they resemble. An
  allied species (<i>Echidna hystrix</i>) inhabits south-east Australia.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Australia (with Tasmania) possesses about 630 species of birds, of which
  485 are land-birds. Not more than about one-twentieth of these are found elsewhere, so that it has
  a larger proportion of endemic species than any other sub-region on the globe. These birds are
  divided among the several orders as follows:</p>

      <td class="ar pr5">15</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The Psittaci, we see, are very richly represented, while the Picariæ are comparatively few; and
  the Columbæ are scarce as compared with their abundance in the Austro-Malay sub-region.</p>

  <p>Birds seem to be very evenly distributed over all Australia; comparatively few genera of
  importance being locally restricted. In the eastern districts alone, we find <i>Origma</i>, and
  <i>Orthonyx</i> (Sylviidæ); <i>Sericulus</i> and <i>Ptilorhynchus</i> (Paradiseidæ);
  <i>Leucosarcia</i> (Columbidæ); and <i>Talegalla</i> (Megapodiidæ). <i>Nectarinia</i>,
  <i>Pitta</i>, <i>Ptilorhis</i>, <i>Chlamydodera</i>, and <i>Sphecotheres</i>, range from the north
  down the east coasts. <i>Nanodes</i> (Psittacidæ), and <i>Lipoa</i> (Megapodiidæ), are southern
  forms, the first extending <span class="pagenum" id="page441">{441}</span>to Tasmania; which
  island appears to possess no peculiar genus of birds except <i>Eudyptes</i>, one of the penguins.
  West Australia has no wholly peculiar genus except <i>Geopsittacus</i>, a curious form of ground
  parroquet; the singular <i>Atrichia</i>, first found here, having been discovered in the east. In
  North Australia, <i>Emblema</i> (Ploceidæ) is the only peculiar Australian genus, but several
  Austro-Malayan and Papuan genera enter,&mdash;as, <i>Syma</i> and <i>Tanysiptera</i> (Alcedinidæ);
  <i>Machærihynchus</i> (Muscicapidæ); <i>Calornis</i> (Sturnidæ); <i>Manucodia</i>,
  <i>Ptilorhis</i>, and <i>Ælur&#x0153;dus</i> (Paradiseidæ); <i>Megapodius</i>; and
  <i>Casuarius</i>. The presence of a species of bustard (<i>Eupodotis</i>) in Australia, is very
  curious, its nearest allies being in the plains of India and Africa. Among waders the genus
  <i>Tribonyx</i>, a thick-legged bird somewhat resembling the <i>Notornis</i> of New Zealand,
  though not closely allied to it, is the most remarkable. The district where the typical Australian
  forms most abound is undoubtedly the eastern side of the island. The north and south are both
  somewhat poorer, the west much poorer, although it possesses a few very peculiar forms, especially
  among Mammalia. Tasmania is the poorest of all, a considerable number of genera being here
  wanting; but, except the two peculiar carnivorous marsupials, it possesses nothing to mark it off
  zoologically from the adjacent parts of the main land. It is probable that its insular climate,
  more moist and less variable than that of Australia, may not be suitable to some of the absent
  forms; while others may require more space and more varied conditions, than are offered by a
  comparatively small island.</p>

  <p>The remaining classes of animals have been already discussed in our sketch of the region as a
  whole (p. 396).</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Plate XII. Illustrating the Fauna of Australia.</i>&mdash;In this plate we take
  New South Wales as our locality, and represent chiefly, the more remarkable Australian types of
  birds. The most conspicuous figure is the wonderful lyre-bird (<i>Menura superba</i>), the elegant
  plumage of whose tail is altogether unique in the whole class of birds. The unadorned bird is the
  female. In the centre is the emu (<i>Dromæus novæ-hollandiæ</i>), the representative in Australia,
  of the ostrich in Africa and America, but <span class="pagenum" id="page442">{442}</span>belonging
  to a different family, the Casurariidæ. To the right are a pair of crested pigeons (<i>Ocyphaps
  lophotes</i>), one of the many singular forms of the pigeon family to which the Australian region
  gives birth. In every other part of the globe pigeons are smooth-headed birds, but here they have
  developed three distinct forms of crest, as seen in this bird, the crowned pigeon figured in Plate
  X., and the double-crested pigeon (<i>Lopholæmus antarcticus</i>). The large bird on the tree is
  one of the Australian frog-mouthed goat-suckers (<i>Podargus strigoides</i>), which are called in
  the colony "More-pork," from their peculiar cry. They do not capture their prey on the wing like
  true goat-suckers, but hunt about the branches of trees at dusk, for large insects, and also for
  unfledged birds. A large kangaroo (<i>Macropus giganteus</i>) is seen in the distance; and passing
  through the air, a flying opossum (<i>Petaurus sciureus</i>), a beautiful modification of a
  marsupial, so as to resemble in form and habits the flying squirrels of the northern
  hemisphere.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>III. The Pacific Islands, or Polynesian Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p class="sp4">Although the area of this sub-region is so vast, and the number of islands it
  contains almost innumerable, there is a considerable amount of uniformity in its forms of animal
  life. From the Ladrone islands on the west, to the Marquesas on the east, a distance of more than
  5,000 miles, the same characteristic genera of birds prevail; and this is the only class of
  animals on which we can depend, mammalia being quite absent, and reptiles very scarce. The
  Sandwich Islands, however, form an exception to this uniformity; and, as far as we yet know, they
  are so peculiar that they ought, perhaps, to form a separate sub-region. They are, however,
  geographically a part of Polynesia; and a more careful investigation of their natural history may
  show more points of agreement with the other islands. It is therefore a matter of convenience, at
  present, to keep them in the Polynesian sub-region, which may be divided into Polynesia proper and
  the Sandwich Islands.</p>

  <p>Polynesia proper consists of a number of groups of islands of some importance, and a host of
  smaller intermediate islets. For the purpose of zoological comparison, we may class them in four
  main divisions. 1. The Ladrone and Caroline Islands; 2. New Caledonia and the New Hebrides; 3. The
  Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa Islands; 4. The Society, and Marquesas Islands. The typical Polynesian
  fauna is most developed in the third division; and it will be well to describe this first, and
  then show how the other islands diverge from it, and approximate other sub-regions.</p>

  <p><i>Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa Islands.</i>&mdash;The land-birds inhabiting these islands belong to
  41 genera, of which 17 are characteristic of the Australian region, and 9 more peculiarly
  Polynesian. The characteristic Australian genera are the following: <i>Petroica</i> (Sylviidæ);
  <i>Lalage</i> (Campephagidæ); <i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Myiagra</i>, <i>Rhipidura</i> (Muscicapidæ);
  <i>Pachycephala</i> (Pachycephalidæ); <i>Rectes</i> (Laniidæ); <i>Myzomela</i>, <i>Ptilotis</i>,
  <i>Anthochæra</i> (Meliphagidæ); <i>Amadina</i>, <i>Eythrura</i>, (Ploceidæ); <i>Artamus</i>
  (Artamidæ); <i>Lorius</i> (Trichoglossidæ); <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Phlogænas</i> (Columbidæ);
  <i>Megapodius</i> (Megapodiidæ).</p>

  <p>The peculiar Polynesian genera are:&mdash;<i>Tatare</i>, <i>Lamprolia</i> (Sylviidæ);
  <i>Aplonis</i>, <i>Sturnodes</i> (Sturnidæ); <i>Todiramphus</i> (Alcedinidæ); <i>Pyrhulopsis</i>,
  <i>Cyanoramphus</i>, (Platycercidæ); <i>Coriphilus</i> (Trichoglossidæ); <i>Didunculus</i>
  (Didunculidæ).</p>

  <p>The wide-spread genera are <i>Turdus</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>, <i>Hirundo</i>, <i>Halcyon</i>,
  <i>Collocalia</i>, <i>Eudynamis</i>, <i>Cuculus</i>, <i>Ianth&#x0153;nas</i>, <i>Carpophaga</i>,
  <i>Turtur</i>, <i>Haliæetus</i>, <i>Astur</i>, <i>Circus</i>, <i>Strix</i>, <i>Asio</i>. The
  aquatic birds are fifteen in number, all wide-spread species except one&mdash;a form of moor-hen
  (Gallinulidæ), which has been constituted a new genus <i>Pareudiastes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Society, and Marquesas Islands.</i>&mdash;Here, the number of genera of land-birds has
  considerably diminished, amounting only to 16 in all. The characteristic Australian genera are
  5;&mdash;<i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Anthochæra</i>, <i>Trichoglossus</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, and
  <i>Phlog&#x0153;nas</i>. The Polynesian genera are 4;&mdash;<i>Tatare</i>, <i>Todiramphus</i>,
  <i>Cyanoramphus</i>, <i>Coriphilus</i>, and one recently described genus, <i>Serresius</i>, an
  extraordinary form of large fruit pigeon, here classed under <i>Carpophaga</i>. These remote
  groups have thus all the character of Oceanic islands, even as regards the rest of Polynesia,
  since they <span class="pagenum" id="page444">{444}</span>possess hardly anything, but what they
  might have received by immigration over a wide extent of ocean.</p>

  <p><i>Ladrone, and Caroline Islands.</i>&mdash;These extensive groups of small islands are very
  imperfectly known, yet a considerable number of birds have been obtained. They possess two
  peculiar Polynesian genera, <i>Tatare</i> and <i>Sturnodes</i>; one peculiar sub-genus,
  <i>Psammathia</i> (here included under <i>Acrocephalus</i>); and ten of the typical Australian
  genera found in Polynesia,&mdash;<i>Lalage</i>, <i>Monarcha</i>, <i>Myiagra</i>, <i>Rhipidura</i>,
  <i>Myzomela</i>, <i>Erythrura</i>, <i>Artamus</i>, <i>Phlog&#x0153;nas</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, and
  <i>Megapodius</i>, as well as the Papuan genus <i>Rectes</i>, and the Malayan
  <i>Calornis</i>;&mdash;so that they can be certainly placed in the sub-region. Genera which do not
  occur in the other Polynesian islands are, <i>Acrocephalus</i>, (s.g. <i>Psammathia</i>)
  originally derived perhaps from the Philippines; and <i>Caprimulgus</i>, a peculiar species,
  allied to one from Japan.</p>

  <p><i>New Caledonia, and the New Hebrides.</i>&mdash;Although these islands seem best placed with
  Polynesia, yet they form a transition to Australia proper, and to the Papuan group. They possess
  30 genera of land-birds, 18 of which are typical of the Australian region; but while 13 are also
  Polynesian, there are 5 which do not pass further east. These are <i>Acanthiza</i>,
  <i>Eopsaltria</i>, <i>Gliciphila</i>, <i>Philemon</i>, and <i>Ianth&#x0153;nas</i>. The peculiar
  Polynesian genus, <i>Aplonis</i>, of which three species inhabit New Caledonia, link it to the
  other portions of the sub-region. The following are the genera at present known from New
  Caledonia:&mdash;<i>Turdus</i>, <i>Acanthiza</i>, <i>Campephaga</i>, <i>Lalage</i>,
  <i>Myiagra</i>, <i>Rhipidura</i>, <i>Pachycephala</i>, <i>Eopsaltria</i>, <i>Corvus</i>,
  <i>Physocorax</i> (s.g. of <i>Corvus</i>, allied to the jackdaws), <i>Glicphila</i>,
  <i>Anthochæra</i>, <i>Philemon</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>, <i>Erythrura</i>, <i>Aplonis</i>,
  <i>Artamus</i>, <i>Cuculus</i>, <i>Halcyon</i>, <i>Collocalia</i>, <i>Cyanoramphus</i>,
  <i>Trichoglossus</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Carpophaga</i>, <i>Macropygia</i>,
  <i>Ianth&#x0153;nas</i>, <i>Chalcophaps</i>, <i>Haliastur</i>, <i>Accipiter</i>. The curious
  <i>Rhinochetus jubatus</i>, forming the type of a distinct family of birds (Rhinochetidæ), allied
  to the herons, is only known from New Caledonia.</p>

  <p>It thus appears, that not more than about 50 genera and 150 species of land-birds, are known
  from the vast number of islands that are scattered over the Central Pacific, and it is not
  probable <span class="pagenum" id="page445">{445}</span>that the number will be very largely
  increased. Some of the species, as the <i>Eudynamis taitensis</i> and <i>Tatare longirostris</i>,
  range over 40° of longitude, from the Fiji Islands to the Marquesas. In other genera, as
  <i>Cyanoramphus</i> and <i>Ptilopus</i>, each important island or group of islands, has its
  peculiar species. The connection of all these islands with each other, on the one hand, and their
  close relation to the Australian region, on the other, are equally apparent; but we have no
  sufficient materials for speculating with any success, on the long series of changes that have
  brought about their existing condition, as regards their peculiar forms of animal life.</p>

  <p><i>Sandwich Islands.</i>&mdash;This somewhat extensive group of large islands, is only known to
  contain 11 genera and 18 species of indigenous land-birds; and even of this small number, two
  birds of prey are wide ranging species, which may well have reached the islands during their
  present isolated condition. These latter are, <i>Strix delicatula</i>, an owl spread over
  Australia and the Pacific; and <i>Asio accipitrinus</i>, a species which has reached the Galapagos
  from S. America, and thence perhaps the Sandwich Islands. Of the remaining 8 genera, one is a crow
  (<i>Corvus hawaiensis</i>), and another a fishing eagle (<i>Pandion solitarius</i>), of peculiar
  species; leaving 7 genera, which are all (according to Mr. Sclater) peculiar. First we have
  <i>Chasiempis</i>, a genus of Muscicapidæ, containing two species (which may however belong to
  distinct genera); and as the entire family is unknown on the American continent these birds must
  almost certainly be allied to some of the numerous Muscicapine forms of the Australian region.
  Next we have the purely Australian family Meliphagidæ, represented by two
  genera,&mdash;<i>Moho</i>, an isolated form, and <i>Chætoptila</i>, a genus established by Mr.
  Sclater for a bird before classed in <i>Entomyza</i>, an Australian group. The four remaining
  genera are believed by Mr. Sclater to belong to one group, the Drepanididæ, altogether confined to
  the Sandwich Islands. Two of them, <i>Drepanis</i> and <i>Hemignathus</i>, with three species
  each, are undoubtedly allied; the other two, <i>Loxops</i> and <i>Psittirostra</i>, have usually
  been classed as finches. The former seem to approach the Dicæidæ; and all resemble this group in
  their coloration,</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page446">{446}</span></div>

  <p>The aquatic birds and waders all belong to wide-spread genera, and only one or two are peculiar
  species.</p>

  <p>The Sandwich Islands thus possess a larger proportion of peculiar genera and species of
  land-birds than any other group of islands, and they are even more strikingly characterised by
  what seems to be a peculiar family. The only other class of terrestrial animals at all adequately
  represented on these islands, are the land shells; and here too we find a peculiar family,
  sub-family, or genus (Achatinella or Achatinellidæ) consisting of a number of genera, or
  sub-genera,&mdash;according to the divergent views of modern conchologists,&mdash;and nearly 300
  species. The Rev. J. T. Gulick, who has made a special study of these shells on the spot,
  considers that there are 10 genera, some of which are confined to single islands. The species are
  so restricted that their average range is not more than five or six square miles, while some are
  confined to a tract of only two square miles in extent, and very few range over an entire island.
  Some species are confined to the mountain ridges, others to the valleys; and each ridge or valley
  possesses its peculiar species. Considerably more than half the species occur in the island of
  Oahu, where there is a good deal of forest. Very few shells belonging to other groups occur, and
  they are all small and obscure; the Achatinellæ almost monopolising the entire archipelago.</p>

  <p><i>Remarks on the probable past history of the Sandwich Islands.</i>&mdash;The existence of
  these peculiar groups of birds and land-shells in so remote a group of volcanic islands, clearly
  indicates that they are but the relics of a more extensive land; and the reefs and islets that
  stretch for more than 1,000 miles in a west-north-west direction, may be the remains of a country
  once sufficiently extensive to develope these and many other, now extinct, forms of life.<a
  id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some light may perhaps be thrown on the past history of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page447">{447}</span>Sandwich Islands, by the peculiar plants which are found on their
  mountains. The peak of Teneriffe produces no Alpine plants of European type, and this has been
  considered to prove that it has been always isolated; whereas the occurrence of North Temperate
  forms on the mountains of Java, accords with other evidence of this island having once formed part
  of the Asiatic continent. Now on the higher summits of the Sandwich Islands, nearly 30 genera of
  Arctic and North Temperate flowering plants have been found. Many of these occur also in the South
  Temperate zone, in Australia or New Zealand; but there are others which seem plainly to point to a
  former connection with some North Temperate land, probably California, as a number of islets are
  scattered in the ocean between the two countries. The most interesting genera are the
  following:&mdash;<i>Silene</i>, which is wholly North Temperate, except that it occurs in S.
  Africa; <i>Vicia</i>, also North Temperate, and in South Temperate America; <i>Fragaria</i>, with
  a similar distribution; <i>Aster</i>, widely spread in America, otherwise North Temperate only;
  <i>Vaccinium</i>, wholly confined to the northern hemisphere, in cold and temperate climates. None
  of these are found in Australia or New Zealand; and their presence in the Sandwich Islands seems
  clearly to indicate a former approximation to North Temperate America, although the absence of any
  American forms of vertebrata renders it certain that no actual land connection ever took
  place.</p>

  <p>Recent soundings have shown, that the Sandwich Islands rise from a sea which is 3,000 fathoms
  or 18,000 feet deep; while there is a depth of at least 2,000 fathoms all across to California on
  one side, and to Japan on the other. Between the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands,
  and Australia, the depth is about 1,300 fathoms, and between Sydney and New Zealand 2,600 fathoms;
  showing, in every case, a general accordance between the depth of sea and the approximation of the
  several faunas. In a few more years, when it is to be hoped we shall know the contour of the
  sea-bottom better than that of the continents, we shall be able to arrive at more definite and
  trustworthy conclusions as to the probable changes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page448">{448}</span>of land and sea by which the phenomena of animal distribution in the
  Pacific have been brought about.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles of the Polynesian Sub-region.</i>&mdash;The researches of Mr. Darwin on Coral
  Islands, proved, that large areas in the Pacific Ocean have been recently subsiding; but the
  peculiar forms of life which they present, no less clearly indicate the former existence of some
  extensive lands. The total absence of Mammalia, however, shows either that these lands never
  formed part of the Australian or Papuan continents, or if they did, that they have been since
  subjected to such an amount of subsidence as to exterminate most of their higher terrestrial forms
  of life. It is a remarkable circumstance, that although Mammalia (except bats) are wanting, there
  are a considerable number of reptiles ranging over the whole sub-region. Lizards are the most
  numerous, five families and fourteen genera being represented, as follows<span

  <p>The first five are wide-spread genera, represented mostly by peculiar species; but sometimes
  the species themselves have a wide range, as in the case of <i>Ablepharus
  p&#x0153;cilopleurus</i>, which (according to Dr. Günther) is found in Timor, Australia, New
  Caledonia, Savage Island (one of the Samoa group), and the Sandwich Islands! <i>Gehyra</i> and
  <i>Heteronota</i> are Australian genera; while <i>Lophura</i> has reached the Pelew Islands from
  the Moluccas. The remainder (printed in italics), are peculiar genera; <i>Brachylophus</i> being
  especially interesting as an example of an <span class="pagenum"
  id="page449">{449}</span>otherwise peculiar American family, occurring so far across the
  Pacific.</p>

  <p>Snakes are much less abundant, only four genera being represented, one of them marine. They
  are, <i>Anoplodipsas</i>, a peculiar genus of Amblycephalidæ from New Caledonia; <i>Enygrus</i>, a
  genus of Pythonidæ from the Fiji Islands; <i>Ogmodon</i>, a peculiar genus of Elapidæ, also from
  the Fiji Islands, but ranging to Papua and the Moluccas; and <i>Platurus</i>, a wide-spread genus
  of sea-snakes (Hydrophidæ). In the more remote Sandwich and Society Islands there appear to be no
  snakes. This accords with our conclusion that lizards have some special means of dispersal over
  the ocean which detracts from their value as indicating zoo-geographical affinities; which is
  further proved by the marvellous range of a single species (referred to above) from Australia to
  the Sandwich Islands.</p>

  <p>A species of <i>Hyla</i> is said to inhabit the New Hebrides, and several species of
  <i>Platymantis</i> (tree-frogs) are found in the Fiji Islands; but otherwise the Amphibians appear
  to be unrepresented in the sub-region, though they will most likely be found in so large an island
  as New Caledonia.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From the foregoing sketch, it appears, that although the reptiles present some
  special features, they agree on the whole with the birds, in showing, that the islands of
  Polynesia all belong to the Australian region, and that in the Fiji Islands is to be found the
  fullest development of their peculiar fauna.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>IV. New Zealand Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>The islands of New Zealand are more completely oceanic than any other extensive tract of land,
  being about 1,200 miles from Australia and nearly the same distance from New Caledonia and the
  Friendly Isles. There are, however, several islets scattered around, whose productions show that
  they belong to the same sub-region;&mdash;the principal being, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe's Island,
  and the Kermadec Isles, on the north; Chatham Island on the east; the Auckland and Macquarie Isles
  on the south;&mdash;and if these were once joined to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page450">{450}</span>New Zealand, there would have been formed an island-continent not much
  inferior in extent to Australia itself.</p>

  <p>New Zealand is wholly situated in the warmer portion of the Temperate zone, and enjoys an
  exceptionally mild and equable climate. It has abundant moisture, and thus comes within the limits
  of the South-Temperate forest zone; and this leads to its productions often resembling those of
  the tropical, but moist and wooded, islands of the Pacific, rather than those of the temperate,
  but arid and scantily wooded plains of Australia. The two islands of New Zealand are about the
  same extent (approximately) as the British Isles, but the difference in the general features of
  their natural history is very great. There are, in the former, no mammalia, less than half as many
  birds, very few reptiles and fresh-water fishes, and an excessive and most unintelligible poverty
  of insects; yet, considering the situation of the islands and their evidently long-continued
  isolation, the wonder rather is that their fauna is so varied and interesting as it is found to
  be. Our knowledge of this fauna, though no doubt far from complete, is sufficiently ample; and it
  will be well to give a pretty full account of it, in order to see what conclusions may be drawn as
  to its origin.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The only mammals positively known as indigenous to New Zealand are two
  bats, both peculiar to it,&mdash;<i>Scotophilus tuberculatus</i> and <i>Mystacina tuberculata</i>.
  The former is allied to Australian forms; the latter is more interesting, as being a peculiar
  genus of the family Noctilionidæ, which does not exist in Australia; and in having decided
  resemblances to the Phyllostomidæ of South America, so that it may almost be considered to be a
  connecting link between the two families. A forest rat is said to have once abounded on the
  islands, and to have been used for food by the natives; but there is much doubt as to what it
  really was, and whether it was not an introduced species. The seals are wide-spread antarctic
  forms which have no geographical significance.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;About 145 species of birds are natives of New Zealand, of which 88 are
  waders or aquatics, leaving 57 land-birds <span class="pagenum" id="page451">{451}</span>belonging
  to 34 genera. Of this latter number, 16, or nearly half, are peculiar; and there are also 5
  peculiar genera of waders and aquatic birds, making 21 in all. Of the remaining genera of
  land-birds, four are cosmopolite or of very wide range, while the remainder are characteristic of
  the Australian region. The following is a list of the Australian genera found in New Zealand:
  <i>Sphenæacus</i>, <i>Gerygone</i>, <i>Orthonyx</i> (Sylviidæ); <i>Graucalus</i> (Campephagidæ);
  <i>Rhipidura</i> (Muscicapidæ); <i>Anthochæra</i> (Meliphagidæ); <i>Zosterops</i> (Dicæidæ);
  <i>Cyanoramphus</i> (Platycercidæ); <i>Carpophaga</i> (Columbidæ); <i>Hieracidea</i> (Falconidæ);
  <i>Tribonyx</i> (Rallidæ). Besides these there are several genera of wide range, as
  follows:&mdash;<i>Anthus</i> (Motacillidæ); <i>Hirundo</i> (Hirundinidæ); <i>Chrysococcyx</i>,
  <i>Eudynamis</i> (Cuculidæ); <i>Halcyon</i> (Alcedinidæ); <i>Coturnix</i> (Tetraonidæ);
  <i>Circus</i> (Falconidæ); <i>Athene</i> (Strigidæ).</p>

  <p>Most of the above genera are represented by peculiar New Zealand species, but in several cases
  the species are identical with those of Australia, as in the following: <i>Anthochæra
  carunculata</i>, <i>Zosterops lateralis</i>, <i>Hirundo nigricans</i>, and <i>Chrysococcyx
  lucidus</i>; also one&mdash;<i>Eudynamis taitensis</i>&mdash;which is Polynesian.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We have thus a wonderful amount of speciality; yet the affinities of the fauna,
  whenever they can be traced, are with Australia or Polynesia. Nine genera of New Zealand birds are
  characteristically Australian, and the eight genera of wide range are Australian also. Of the
  peculiar genera, 7 or 8 are undoubtedly allied to Australian groups. There are also four
  Australian and one Polynesian <i>species</i>. Even the peculiar <i>family</i>, Nestoridæ is allied
  to the Australian Trichoglossidæ. We have therefore every gradation of similarity to the
  Australian fauna, from identical species, through identical genera, and allied genera, to distinct
  but allied families; clearly indicating very long continued yet rare immigations from Australia or
  Polynesia; immigrations which are continued down to our day. For resident ornithologists believe,
  that the <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> has found its way to New Zealand within the last few years,
  and that the two cuckoos now migrate annually, the one from Australia, the other from some <span
  class="pagenum" id="page453">{453}</span>part of Polynesia, distances of more than 1,000 miles!
  These facts seem, however, to have been accepted on insufficient evidence and to be in themselves
  extremely improbable. It is observed that the cuckoos appear annually in certain districts and
  again disappear; but their course does not seem to have been traced, still less have they ever
  been actually seen arriving or departing across the ocean. In a country which has still such wide
  tracts of unsettled land, it is very possible that the birds in question may only move from one
  part of the islands to another.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Islets of the New Zealand Sub-region.</i></p>

  <p>We will here notice the smaller islands belonging to the sub-region, as it is chiefly their
  birds that possess any interest.</p>

  <p><i>Norfolk Island.</i>&mdash;The land-birds recorded from this island amount to 15 species, of
  which 8 are Australian, viz.: <i>Climacteris scandens</i>, <i>Symmorphus leucopygius</i>,
  <i>Zosterops tenuirostris</i> and <i>Z. albogularis</i>, <i>Halcyon sanctus</i>, <i>Platycercus
  pennanti</i>, <i>Carpophaga spadicea</i>, <i>Phapspicata</i> and <i>P. chalcoptera</i>. Of the
  peculiar species three belong to Australian genera; <i>Petroica</i>, <i>Gerygone</i>, and
  <i>Rhipidura</i>; one to a cosmopolitan genus, <i>Turdus</i>. So far the affinity seems to be all
  Australian, and there remain only three birds which ally this island to New
  Zealand,&mdash;<i>Nestor productus</i>, <i>Cyanoramphus rayneri</i>, and <i>Notornis alba</i>. The
  former inhabited the small Phillip Island (close to Norfolk Island) but is now extinct. Being a
  typical New Zealand genus, quite incapable of flying across the sea, its presence necessitates
  some former connexion between the two islands, and it is therefore perhaps of more weight than all
  the Australian genera and species, which are birds capable of long flights. The
  <i>Cyanoramphus</i> is allied to a New Zealand broad-tailed parroquet. The <i>Notornis alba</i> is
  extinct, but two specimens exist in museums, and it is even a stronger case than the
  <i>Nestor</i>, as showing a former approximation or union of this island with New Zealand. A
  beautiful figure of this bird is given in the <i>Ibis</i> for 1873.</p>

  <p><i>Lord Howe's Island.</i>&mdash;This small island, situated half-way between Australia and
  Norfolk Island, is interesting, as containing a peculiar species of the New Zealand genus
  <i>Ocydromus</i>, or <span class="pagenum" id="page454">{454}</span>wood-hen (<i>O.
  sylvestris</i>). There is also a peculiar thrush, <i>Turdus vinitinctus</i>. Its other birds are
  wholly of Australian types, and most of them probably Australian species. The following have been
  observed, and no doubt constitute nearly its whole indigenous bird fauna. <i>Acanthiza</i> sp.,
  <i>Rhipidura</i> sp., <i>Pachycephala gutturalis</i>, <i>Zosterops strennuus</i> and <i>Z.
  tephropleurus</i>, <i>Strepera</i> sp., <i>Halcyon</i> sp., and <i>Chalcophaga chrysochlora</i>.
  The two species of <i>Zosterops</i> are peculiar. The <i>Ocydromus</i> is important enough to ally
  this island to New Zealand rather than to Australia; and if the white bird seen there is, as
  supposed, the <i>Notornis alba</i> which is extinct in Norfolk Island, the connection will be
  rendered still more clear.</p>

  <p><i>Chatham Islands.</i>&mdash;These small islands, 450 miles east of New Zealand, possess about
  40 species of birds, of which 13 are land-birds. All but one belong to New Zealand genera, and all
  but five are New Zealand species. The following are the genera of the land-birds:
  <i>Sphenæacus</i>, <i>Gerygone</i>, <i>Myiomoira</i>, <i>Rhipidura</i>, <i>Zosterops</i>,
  <i>Anthus</i>, <i>Prosthemadera</i>, <i>Anthornis</i>, <i>Chrysococcyx</i>, <i>Cyanoramphus</i>,
  <i>Carpophaga</i>, <i>Circus</i>. The peculiar species are <i>Anthornis melanocephala</i>,
  <i>Myiomoira diffenbachi</i> and <i>M. traversi</i>, <i>Rhipidura flabellifera</i>, and a peculiar
  rail incapable of flight, named by Captain Hutton <i>Cabalus modestus</i>. It is stated that the
  <i>Zosterops</i> differs from that of New Zealand, and is also a migrant; and it is therefore
  believed to come every year from Australia, passing over New Zealand, a distance of nearly 1,700
  miles! Further investigation will perhaps discover some other explanation of the facts. It is also
  stated, that the pigeon and one of the small birds (? <i>Gerygone</i> or <i>Zosterops</i>) have
  arrived at the islands within the last eight years. The natives further declare, that both the
  <i>Stringops</i> and <i>Apteryx</i> once inhabited the islands, but were exterminated about the
  year 1835.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>The Auckland Islands.</i>&mdash;These are situated nearly 300 miles south of New
  Zealand, and possess six land-birds, of which three are peculiar,&mdash;<i>Anthus
  aucklandicus</i>, <i>Cyanoramphus aucklandicus</i>, and <i>C. malherbii</i>, the others being New
  Zealand species of <i>Myiomoira</i>, <i>Prosthemadera</i>, and <i>Anthornis</i>. It is remarkable
  that two peculiar parrots of the same genus should inhabit these small islands; but such
  localities seem favourable to the Platycercidæ, for another peculiar species is found in the
  remote Macquarie Islands, more than 400 miles farther south. A peculiar species and genus of
  ducks, <i>Nesonetta aucklandica</i>, is also found here, and as far as yet known, nowhere else. A
  species of the northern genus <i>Mergus</i> is also found on these islands, and has been recently
  obtained by Baron von Hügel.</p>

  <p><i>Plate XIII. Illustrating the peculiar Ornithology of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;Our artist has
  here depicted a group of the most remarkable and characteristic of the New Zealand birds. In the
  middle foreground is the Owl-parrot or Kakapoe (<i>Stringops habroptilus</i>), a nocturnal
  burrowing parrot, that feeds on fern-shoots, roots, berries, and occasionally lizards; that climbs
  but does not fly; and that has an owl-like mottled plumage and facial disc. The wings however are
  not rudimentary, but fully developed; and it seems to be only the muscles that have become useless
  for want of exercise. This would imply, that these birds have not long been inhabitants of New
  Zealand only, but were developed in other countries (perhaps Australia) where their wings were of
  use to them.</p>

  <p>Beyond the Kakapoe are a pair of the large rails, <i>Notornis mantelli</i>; heavy birds with
  short wings quite useless for flight, and with massive feet and bill of a red colour. On the right
  is a pair of Kiwis (<i>Apteryx australis</i>), one of the queerest and most unbird-like of living
  birds. It has very small and rudimentary wings, entirely concealed by the hair-like plumage, and
  no tail. It is nocturnal, feeding chiefly on worms, which it extracts from soft earth by means of
  its long bill. The genus <i>Apteryx</i> forms a distinct family of birds, of which four species
  are now known, besides some which are extinct. They are allied to the Cassowary and to the
  gigantic extinct <i>Dinornis</i>. On the wing are a pair of Crook-billed Plovers (<i>Anarhynchus
  frontalis</i>), remarkable for being the only birds known which have the bill bent sideways. This
  was at first thought to be a malformation; but it is now proved to be a constant character of the
  species, as it exists even in the young chicks; yet the purpose served by such an anomalous
  structure is not yet discovered. <span class="pagenum" id="page456">{456}</span>No country on the
  globe can offer such an extraordinary set of birds as are here depicted.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;These consist almost wholly of lizards, there being no land-snakes and
  only one frog. Twelve species of lizards are known, belonging to three genera, one of which is
  peculiar, as are all the species. <i>Hinulia</i>, with two species, and <i>Mocoa</i>, with four
  species (one of which extends to the Chatham Islands), belong to the Scincidæ; both are very
  wide-spread genera and occur in Australia. The peculiar genus <i>Naultinus</i>, with six species,
  belongs to the Geckotidæ, a family spread over the whole world.</p>

  <p>The most extraordinary and interesting reptile of New Zealand is, however, the <i>Hatteria
  punctata</i>, a lizard-like animal living in holes, and found in small islands on the north-east
  coast, and more rarely on the main land. It is somewhat intermediate in structure between lizards
  and crocodiles, and also has bird-like characters in the form of its ribs. It constitutes, not
  only a distinct family, Rhyncocephalidæ, but a separate order of reptiles, Rhyncocephalina. It is
  quite isolated from all other members of the class; and is probably a slightly modified
  representative of an ancient and generalised form, which has been superseded in larger areas by
  the more specialized lizards and saurians.</p>

  <p>The only representatives of the Ophidia are two sea-snakes of Australian and Polynesian
  species, and of no geographical interest.</p>

  <p><i>Amphibia.</i>&mdash;The solitary frog indigenous to New Zealand, belongs to a peculiar
  genus, <i>Liopelma</i>, and to the family Bomburatoridæ, otherwise confined to Europe and
  temperate South America.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fishes.</i>&mdash;There are, according to Captain Hutton, 15 species of
  fresh-water fish in New Zealand, belonging to 7 genera; six species, and one genus
  (<i>Retropinna</i>), being peculiar. <i>Retropinna richardsoni</i> belongs to the Salmonidæ, and
  is the only example of that family occurring in the Southern hemisphere, where it is confined to
  New Zealand and the Chatham Islands. The wide distribution of <i>Galaxias
  attenuatus</i>&mdash;from the <span class="pagenum" id="page457">{457}</span>Chatham Islands to
  South America&mdash;has already been noticed; while another species, <i>G. fasciatus</i>, is found
  in the Chatham and Auckland Isles as well as New Zealand. A second genus peculiar to New Zealand,
  <i>Neochanna</i>, allied to <i>Galaxias</i>, has recently been described. <i>Prototroctes
  oxyrhynchus</i> is allied to an Australian species, but belongs to a family (Haplochitonidæ) which
  is otherwise South American. An eel, <i>Anguilla latirostris</i>, is found in Europe, China, and
  the West Indies, as well as in New Zealand! while the genus <i>Agonostoma</i> ranges to Australia,
  Celebes, Mauritius, and Central America.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;The great poverty of this class is well shown by the fact, that only
  eleven species of butterflies are known to inhabit New Zealand. Of these, six are peculiar, and
  one, <i>Argyrophenga</i> (Satyridæ), is a peculiar genus allied to the Northern genus
  <i>Erebia</i>. The rest are either of wide range, as <i>Pyrameis cardui</i> and <i>Diadema
  bolina</i>; or Australian, as <i>Hamdyaas zoilus</i>; while one, <i>Danais erippus</i>, is
  American, but has also occurred in Australia, and is no doubt a recent introduction into both
  countries. Only one <i>Sphinx</i> is recorded, and no other species of the Sphingina except the
  British currant-moth, <i>Ægeria tipuliformis</i>, doubtless imported. Coleoptera are better
  represented, nearly 300 species having been described, all or nearly all being peculiar. These
  belong to about 150 genera, of which more than 50 are peculiar. No less than 14 peculiar genera
  belong to the Carabidæ, mostly consisting of one or two species, but <i>Demetrida</i> has 3, and
  <i>Metaglymma</i> 8 species. Other important genera are <i>Dicrochile</i>, <i>Homalosoma</i>,
  <i>Mecodema</i>, and <i>Scopodes</i>, all in common with Australia. <i>Mecodema</i> and
  <i>Metaglymma</i> are the largest genera. Even the Auckland Islands have two small genera of
  Carabidæ found nowhere else.</p>

  <p>Cicindelidæ are represented in New Zealand by 6 species of <i>Cicindela</i>, and 1 of
  <i>Dystipsidera</i>, a genus peculiar to the Australian region.</p>

  <p>The Lucanidæ are represented by two peculiar genera, <i>Dendroblax</i> and <i>Oxyomus</i>; two
  Australian genera, <i>Lissotes</i> and <i>Ceratognathus</i>; and by the almost cosmopolite
  <i>Dorcus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Scarabeidæ consist of ten species only, belonging to four <span class="pagenum"
  id="page458">{458}</span>genera, two of which are peculiar (<i>Odontria</i> and
  <i>Stethaspis</i>); and two Australian (<i>Pericoptus</i> and <i>Calonota</i>). There are no
  Cetoniidæ.</p>

  <p>There is only one Buprestid, belonging to the Australian genus <i>Cisseis</i>. The Elateridæ,
  (about a dozen species,) belong mostly to Australian genera, but two, <i>Metablax</i> and
  <i>Ochosternus</i>, are peculiar.</p>

  <p>There are 30 species of Curculionidæ, belonging to 22 genera. Of the genera, 12 are peculiar; 1
  is common to New Zealand and New Caledonia; 5 belong to the Australian region, and the rest are
  widely distributed.</p>

  <p>Longicorns are, next to Carabidæ, the most numerous family, there being, according to Mr. Bates
  (<i>Ann. Nat. Hist.</i>, 1874), about 35 genera, of which 26 are peculiar or highly
  characteristic, and 7 of the others Australian. The largest and most characteristic genera are
  <i>Æmona</i> and <i>Xyloteles</i>, both being peculiar to New Zealand; few of the remainder having
  more than one or two species. <i>Demonax</i> extends to the Moluccas and S. E. Asia. A dozen of
  the genera have no near relations with those of any other country.</p>

  <p>Phytophaga are remarkably scarce, only two species of <i>Colaspis</i> being recorded; and there
  is only a single species of <i>Coccinella</i>.</p>

  <p>The other orders of Insects appear to be equally deficient. Hymenoptera are very poorly
  represented, only a score of species being yet known; but two of the genera are peculiar, as are
  all the species. The Neuroptera and Heteroptera are also very scarce, and several of the species
  are wide-spread forms of the Australian region. The few species of Homoptera are all peculiar. The
  Myriapoda afford some interesting facts. There are nine or ten species, all peculiar. One genus,
  <i>Lithobius</i>, ranges over the northern hemisphere as far south as Singapore, and probably
  through the Malay Archipelago, but is not found in Australia. <i>Henicops</i> occurs elsewhere
  only in Tasmania and Chili. <i>Cryptops</i>, only in the north temperate zone; while two others,
  <i>Cermatia</i> and <i>Cormocephalus</i>, both occur in Australia.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page459">{459}</span></div>

  <p><i>Land-Shells.</i>&mdash;Of these, 114 species are known, 97 being peculiar. Three species of
  <i>Helix</i> are also found in Australia, and five more in various tropical islands of the
  Pacific. <i>Nanina</i>, <i>Lymnæa</i>, and <i>Assiminea</i>, are found in Polynesia or Malaya, but
  not in Australia. <i>Amphibola</i> is an Australian genus, as is <i>Janella</i>. <i>Testacella</i>
  and <i>Limax</i> belong to the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>From the Chatham Islands, 82 species of shells are known, all being New Zealand species, except
  nine, which are peculiar.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>The Ancient Fauna of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;One of the most remarkable features of the New
  Zealand fauna, is the existence, till quite recent times, of an extensive group of wingless
  birds,&mdash;called Moas by the natives&mdash;many of them of gigantic size, and which evidently
  occupied the place which, in other countries, is filled by the mammalia. The most recent account
  of these singular remains, is that by Dr. Haast, who, from a study of the extensive series of
  specimens in the Canterbury museum, believes, that they belong to two families, distinguished by
  important differences of structure, and constitute four genera,&mdash;<i>Dinornis</i> and
  <i>Miornis</i>, forming the family Dinornithidæ; <i>Palapteryx</i> and <i>Euryapteryx</i>, forming
  the family Palapterygidæ. These were mostly larger birds than the living <i>Apteryx</i>, and some
  of them much larger even than the African ostrich, and were more allied to the Casuariidæ and
  Struthionidæ than to the Apterygidæ. No less than eleven species of these birds have been
  discovered; all are of recent geological date, and there are indications that some of them may
  have been in existence less than a century ago, and were really exterminated by man. Remains have
  been found (of apparently the same recent date) of species of <i>Apteryx</i>, <i>Stringops</i>,
  <i>Ocydromus</i>, and many other living forms, as well as of <i>Harpagornis</i>, a large bird of
  prey, and <i>Cnemiornis</i>, a gigantic goose. Bodies of the <i>Hatteria punctata</i> have also
  been found along with those of the Moa, showing that this remarkable reptile was once more
  abundant on the main islands than it is now.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>The Origin of the New Zealand Fauna.</i>&mdash;Having now given <span class="pagenum"
  id="page460">{460}</span>an outline sketch of the main features of the New Zealand fauna and of
  its relations with other regions, we may consider what conclusions are fairly deducible from the
  facts. As the outlying Norfolk, Chatham, and Lord Howe's Islands, are all inhabited (or have
  recently been so) by birds of New Zealand type or even identical species, almost incapable of
  flight, we may infer that these islands show us the former minimum extent of the land-area in
  which the peculiar forms which characterise the sub-region were developed. If we include the
  Auckland and Macquarie Islands to the south, we shall have a territory of not much less extent
  than Australia, and separated from it by perhaps several hundred miles of ocean. Some such ancient
  land must have existed to allow of the development and specialization of so many peculiar forms of
  birds, and it probably remained with but slight modifications for a considerable geological
  period. During all this time it would interchange many of its forms of life with Australia, and
  there would arise that amount of identity of genera between the two countries which we find to
  exist. Its extension southwards, perhaps considerably beyond the Macquaries, would bring it within
  the range of floating ice during colder epochs, and within easy reach of the antarctic continent
  during the warm periods; and thus would arise that interchange of genera and species with South
  America, which forms one of the characteristic features of the natural history of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Captain F. W. Hutton (to whose interesting paper on the Geographical relations of the New
  Zealand Fauna we are indebted for some of our facts) insists upon the necessity of former
  land-connections in various directions, and especially of an early southern continental period,
  when New Zealand, Australia, Southern Africa, and South America, were united. Thus he would
  account for the existence of Struthious birds in all these countries, and for the various other
  groups of birds, reptiles, fishes, or insects which have no obvious means of traversing the
  ocean,&mdash;and this union must have occurred before mammalia existed in any of these countries.
  But such a supposition is quite unnecessary, if we consider that all wingless land-birds and some
  water-birds (as the Gare-fowl <span class="pagenum" id="page461">{461}</span>and Steamer Duck) are
  probably cases of abortion of useless organs, and that the common ancestors of the various forms
  of Struthiones may have been capable of a moderate degree of flight; or they may have originated
  in the northern hemisphere, as already explained in Chap. XI. p. 287. The existence of two, if not
  three, distinct families of these birds in New Zealand, proves that the original type was here
  isolated at a very early date, and being wholly free from the competition of mammalia, became more
  differentiated than elsewhere. The <i>Hatteria</i> is probably coeval with these early forms, and
  is the only relic of a whole order of reptiles, which once perhaps ranged far over the globe.</p>

  <p>Still less does any other form of animal inhabiting New Zealand, require a land connection with
  distant countries to account for its presence. With the example before us of the Bermudas and
  Azores, to which a great variety of birds fly annually over vast distances, and even of the recent
  arrival of new birds in New Zealand and Chatham Island, we may be sure that the ancestors of every
  New Zealand bird could easily have reached its shores during the countless ages which elapsed
  while the <i>Dinornis</i> and <i>Apteryx</i> were developing. The wonderful range of some of the
  existing species of lizards and fresh-water fish, as already given, proves that they too possess
  means of dispersal which have sufficed to spread them, within a comparatively recent period, over
  countries separated by thousands of miles of ocean; and the fact that a group like the snakes, so
  widely distributed and for which the climate of New Zealand is so well adapted, does not exist
  there, is an additional proof that land connection had nothing to do with the introduction of the
  existing fauna. We have already (p. 398), discussed in some detail the various modes in which the
  dispersal of animals in the southern hemisphere has been effected; and in accordance with the
  principles there established, we conclude, that the New Zealand fauna, living and extinct,
  demonstrates the existence of an extensive tract of land in the vicinity of Australia, Polynesia,
  and the Antarctic continent, without having been once actually connected with either of these
  countries, since the period when mammalia had peopled <span class="pagenum"
  id="page462">{462}</span>all the great continents. That event certainly dates back to Secondary,
  if not to Palæozoic, times, because so dominant a group must soon have spread over the whole
  continuous land-area of the globe. We have no reason for believing that birds were an earlier
  development; and certainly cannot, with any probability, place the origin of the Struthiones
  before that of Mammals.</p>

  <p><i>Causes of the Poverty of Insect-life in New Zealand: its Influence on the Character of the
  Flora.</i>&mdash;The extreme paucity of insects in New Zealand, to which we have already alluded,
  seems to call for some attempt at explanation. No other country in the world, in which the
  conditions are equally favourable for insect-life, and which has either been connected with, or is
  in proximity to, any of the large masses of land, presents a similar phenomenon. The only approach
  to it is in the Galapagos, and in some of the islands of the Pacific; and in each of these cases
  the absence of mammals leads us to infer, that no connection with a continent has ever taken
  place. Yet the fauna of New Zealand evidently dates back to a remote geological epoch, and it
  seems strange that an abundance of indigenous insects have not been developed, especially when we
  consider the vast antiquity that most of the orders and families, and many of the genera, of
  insects possess (see p. <span class="correction" title="&quot;156&quot; in printed work, corrected by
  Errata">166</span>), and that they must always have reached the country in greater numbers and
  variety than any of the higher animals. The undoubted fact that such an indigenous insect-fauna
  has not arisen, would therefore lead us to conclude, that insects find the conditions requisite
  for their development only in the great continental masses of land, in strict adaptation to, and
  dependance on, a varied fauna and flora of ever-increasing richness and complexity. A small number
  of widely-separated forms, introduced into a country where the fauna and flora are alike scanty
  and unrelated to them, seem to have little tendency to vary and branch out into that vast network
  of insect-life which enriches all the great continents and their once connected islands.</p>

  <p>It is a striking confirmation on a large scale, of Mr. Darwin's beautiful theory&mdash;that the
  gay colours of flowers have mostly, or <span class="pagenum" id="page463">{463}</span>perhaps,
  wholly been produced, in order to attract insects which aid in their fertilization&mdash;that in
  New Zealand, where insects are so strikingly deficient in variety, the flora should be almost as
  strikingly deficient in gaily-coloured blossoms. Of course there are some exceptions, but as a
  whole, green, inconspicuous, and imperfect flowers prevail, to an extent not to be equalled in any
  other part of the globe; and affording a marvellous contrast to the general brilliancy of
  Australian flowers, combined with the abundance and variety of its insect-life. We must remember,
  too, that the few gay or conspicuous flowering-plants possessed by New Zealand, are almost all of
  Australian, South American, or European <i>genera</i>; the peculiar New Zealand or Antarctic
  genera being almost wholly without conspicuous flowers. In the tropical Galapagos the same thing
  occurs. Mr. Darwin notices the wretched weedy appearance of the vegetation; and states that it was
  some time before he discovered that most of the plants were in flower at the time of his visit!
  And the insect-life was correspondingly deficient, consisting mainly of a few terrestrial
  beetles.</p>

  <p>The poverty of insect-life in New Zealand must, therefore, be a very ancient feature of the
  country; and it furnishes an additional argument against the theory of land-connection with, or
  even any near approach to, either Australia, South Africa, or South America. For in that case
  numbers of winged insects would certainly have entered, and the flowers would then, as in every
  other part of the world, have been rendered attractive to them by the development of coloured
  petals; and this character once acquired would long maintain itself, even if the insects had, from
  some unknown cause, subsequently disappeared.</p>

  <p>After the preceding paragraphs were written, it occurred to me, that if this reasoning were
  correct, New Zealand plants ought to be also deficient in scented flowers; because it is a part of
  the same theory, that the odours of flowers have, like their colours, been developed to attract
  the insects required to aid in their fertilization. I therefore at once applied to my friend Dr.
  Hooker, as the highest authority on New Zealand botany; simply asking whether there was any such
  observed deficiency. His reply <span class="pagenum" id="page464">{464}</span>was:&mdash;"New
  Zealand plants are remarkably scentless, both in regard to the rarity of scented flowers, of
  leaves with immersed glands containing essential oils, and of glandular hairs." There are a few
  exceptional cases, but these seem even more rare than might be expected, so that the confirmation
  of theory is very complete. The circumstance that aromatic leaves are also very scarce, suggests
  the idea that these, too, serve as an attraction to insects. Aromatic plants abound most in arid
  countries, and on Alpine heights; both localities where winged insects are comparatively scarce,
  and where it may be necessary to attract them in every possible way. Dr. Hooker also informs, me
  that since his <i>Introduction to the New Zealand Flora</i> was written, many plants with handsome
  flowers have been discovered, especially among the <i>Ranunculi</i>, shrubby Veronicas, and
  herbaceous Compositæ. The two former, however, are genera of wide range, which may have originated
  in New Zealand by the introduction of plants with handsome flowers, which the few indigenous
  insects would be attracted by, and thus prevent the loss of their gay corollas; so that these
  discoveries will not much affect the general character of the flora, and its very curious bearing
  on the past history of the islands through the relations of flowers and insects.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In judging of the relation here supposed to exist, it must be remembered, that if
  the New Zealand insects have been introduced from the surrounding countries by chance immigrations
  at distant intervals, then, as we go back into the past the insect fauna will become poorer and
  poorer, and still more inadequate than at present to lead to the development of attractive flowers
  and odours. This quite harmonizes with the fact of the ancient indigenous flora being so
  remarkably scentless and inconspicuous, while a few of the more recently introduced genera of
  plants have retained their floral attractions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Concluding Remarks on the Early History of the Australian Region.</i></p>

  <p>We have already discussed in some detail, the various relations of the Australian sub-regions
  to the surrounding Regions, and the geographical changes that appear to have taken place. A very
  <span class="pagenum" id="page465">{465}</span>few observations will therefore suffice, on the
  supposed early history of the Australian region as a whole.</p>

  <p>It was probably far back in the Secondary period, that some portion of the Australian region
  was in actual connection with the northern continent, and became stocked with ancestral forms of
  Marsupials; but from that time till now there seems to have been no further land connection, and
  the Australian lands have thenceforward gone on developing the Marsupial and Monotremate types,
  into the various living and extinct races we now find there. During some portion of the Tertiary
  epoch Australia probably comprised much of its existing area, together with Papua and the Solomon
  Islands, and perhaps extended as far east as the Fiji Islands; while it might also have had a
  considerable extension to the south and west. Some light has recently been thrown on this subject
  by Professor McCoy's researches on the Palæontology of Victoria. He finds abundant marine fossils
  of Eocene and Miocene age, many of which are strikingly similar to those of Europe at the same
  period. Among these are Cetaceans of the genus <i>Squalodon</i>; European species of Plagiostomous
  fishes; mollusca and corals closely resembling those of Europe and North America of the same
  age,&mdash;such as numerous Volutes closely allied to those of the Eocene beds of the Isle of
  Wight, and the genus <i>Dentalium</i> in great abundance, almost or quite identical with European
  tertiary species. Along with these, are found some living species, but always such as now live
  farther north in tropical seas. The Cretaceous and Mesozoic marine fossils are equally close to
  those of Europe.</p>

  <p>The whole of these remains demonstrate that, as in the northern so in the southern hemisphere,
  a much warmer climate prevailed in the Eocene and Miocene periods than at the present time. This
  is a most important result, and one which strongly supports Mr. Belt's view, before referred to,
  that the warmer climates in past geological epochs, and especially that of the Miocene as compared
  with our own, was caused by a diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, leading to a much
  greater uniformity of the seasons for a considerable distance from the equator, and greatly
  reducing the polar area within which the sun would ever <span class="pagenum"
  id="page466">{466}</span>disappear during an entire rotation of the earth. During such a period,
  tropical forms of marine animals would have been able to spread north and south, into what are now
  cool latitudes; and identical genera, and even species, might then have ranged along the southern
  shores of the old Palæarctic continent, from Britain to the Bay of Bengal, and southward along the
  Malayan coasts to Australia,</p>

  <p class="sp3">Numerous Miocene plant-beds have also been found in Victoria, containing abundance
  of Dicotyledonous leaves, which are said generally to resemble those of the Asiatic flora, and of
  the Miocene plant-beds of the Rhine. It is to be hoped these beds will be more closely examined
  for remains of insects, land-shells, and vertebrates, and that the plants will be carefully
  preserved and critically studied; for here probably lies hidden the key, that will solve much of
  the mystery that attaches to the past history of the Australian fauna.</p>

    <p>Marcel de Serres states this as a general fact for wading and swimming birds. He says that
    the old birds arrive in the extreme north almost alone, the young remaining on the shores of the
    Baltic, or on the lakes of Austria, Hungary, and Russia. See his prize essay, <i>Des Causes des
    Migrations</i>, &amp;c. 2nd. ed., Paris, 1845, p. 121.</p>

    <p>Malta is interesting as forming a resting-place for migratory birds, while crossing the
    Mediterranean. It has only eight land and three aquatic birds which are permanent residents; yet
    no less than 278 species have been recorded by Mr. E. A. Wright as visiting or passing over it,
    comprising a large proportion of the European migratory birds. The following are the permanent
    residents: <i>Cerchneis tinnunculus</i>, <i>Strix flammea</i>, <i>Passer salicicola</i>,
    <i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, <i>Corvus monedula</i>, <i>Monticola cyanea</i>, <i>Sylvia

    <p>A remarkable confirmation of this theory, is furnished in the Report to the Royal Society of
    the naturalist to the Kerguelen Island, "Transit Expedition"&mdash;the Rev. A. E. Eaton. Insects
    were assiduously collected, and it was found that almost all were either completely apterous, or
    had greatly abbreviated wings. The only moth found, several flies, and numerous beetles, were
    alike incapable of flight. As this island is subject to violent, and almost perpetual gales,
    even in the finest season, the meaning of the extraordinary loss of wings in almost all the
    insects, can, in this case, hardly be misunderstood.</p>

    crossed the watershed between the Nile tributaries and those of the Shari, in 4½° N. Lat. and
    28½° E. Long. He describes a sudden change in the character of the vegetation, which to the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
